## V1.1.1 (2025/11/17)
- Refresh FlashVSR 1.1 main model package (renamed to `FlashVSR1_1.safetensors` alongside `LQ_proj_in.safetensors` and `TCDecoder.safetensors`) and update latest HuggingFace models.
- Fix the core loader to validate the new filenames and raise clear warnings when any required asset is missing, preventing silent fallbacks.

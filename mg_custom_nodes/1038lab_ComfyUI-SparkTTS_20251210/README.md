## Installation

### Method 1. install on ComfyUI-Manager, search `Comfyui-SparkTTS` and install
install requirment.txt in the ComfyUI-SparkTTS folder
  ```bash
  ./ComfyUI/python_embeded/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Method 2. Clone this repository to your ComfyUI custom_nodes folder:
  ```bash
  cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
  git clone https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-SparkTTS
  ```
  install requirment.txt in the ComfyUI-SparkTTS folder
  ```bash
  ./ComfyUI/python_embeded/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Method 3: Install via Comfy CLI
  Ensure `pip install comfy-cli` is installed.
  Installing ComfyUI `comfy install` (if you don't have ComfyUI Installed)
  install the ComfyUI-SparkTTS, use the following command:
  ```bash
  comfy node registry-install Comfyui-Spark-TTS
  ```
  install requirment.txt in the ComfyUI-SparkTTS folder
  ```bash
  ./ComfyUI/python_embeded/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 4. Manually download the models:
- The model will be automatically downloaded to `ComfyUI/models/TTS/SparkTTS/` when first time using the custom node.
- Manually download the SparkTTS-2.0 model by visiting this [link](https://huggingface.co/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS-0.5B/tree/main), then download the files and place them in the `ComfyUI/models/TTS/SparkTTS/` folder.

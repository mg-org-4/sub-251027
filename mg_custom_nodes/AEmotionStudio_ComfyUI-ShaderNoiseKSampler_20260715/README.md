ComfyUI-ShaderNoiseKSampler is an advanced custom KSampler node that blends standard noise generation with a multi-stage shader-based system. Unlike traditional sampling that teleports randomly between different seeds, this tool provides a structured vehicle for exploring the neighborhood around a chosen seed, using mathematical patterns to navigate along coherent paths through latent space.

> [!TIP]
> Perfect for artists and researchers looking to explore the latent space with more intention, sculpt image features with mathematical precision, and achieve unique visual styles through deliberate exploration rather than random discovery. (Using a fixed seed is key to this deliberate exploration, allowing you to systematically investigate the variations around a chosen starting point.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The Shader Noise KSampler contains a shader display and requires saving, while the Shader Noise KSampler (Direct) *does not* contain a shader display and *does not* require saving. The shader display will help you better understand the parameter controls visually, while the (Direct) version is better for ideation and enables finer control over input values.

## 🚀 Recent Updates

- **Comparer Auto-Fill - 6/12/25**: Both the `Advanced Image Comparer` and `Video Comparer` nodes now feature an `auto_fill` toggle. This addition streamlines your workflow by allowing you to compare with a single input. When `auto_fill` is enabled (the default setting), any empty image or video slot will be automatically populated with the output from the previous generation. This makes iterative A/B testing—comparing your latest creation to the one right before it—faster and more intuitive. It does not pull from your output folder but from the cached images or videos of your current session.

## 🧭 Navigating the Seed Universe

Think of standard image generation, where you try different seeds, as driving from one town to another. Each new seed takes you to a completely different town.

The ShaderNoiseKSampler works differently. It's like picking one town (one specific seed) that you find particularly interesting, and instead of just driving through to the next one, you decide to stop, get out of the car, and really explore *that specific town*. You can wander down its hidden alleyways, check out its diverse neighborhoods, and discover all the unique details and variations it holds. 

The shader noise is your map and the shader parameters (like Noise Scale, Octaves, Warp Strength, etc.) are your compass for this in-depth local exploration:

- **🔍 Noise Scale: The Zoom Control** - Determines how "zoomed in" or "zoomed out" you are in latent space
- **🔬 Octaves: The Detail Slider** - Controls the level of detail and complexity in your noise pattern
- **🌀 Warp Strength: The Non-Linear Navigator** - Creates non-linear paths through latent space
- **🔄 Phase Shift: The Perspective Shifter** - Reveals different "facets" of the same core elements

The core innovation is treating latent space as a territory to be explored rather than a lottery to be played - turning the act of AI image generation into a journey of deliberate artistic discovery guided by the elegant language of mathematical patterns.

## 🔮 The Innovation: Controllable Noise

While traditional samplers rely on pure randomness, **ShaderNoiseKSampler** introduces a paradigm shift: mathematically controllable noise patterns derived from shader technology (shader noise). This isn't just navigation - it's the invention of a new vehicle.

By replacing the standard random noise distribution with structured shader-generated patterns (shader noise), we transform the diffusion process from a random walk into a deliberate journey. The noise itself becomes an artistic medium you can sculpt through mathematical parameters:

- Scale, octaves, and warp create precise noise topographies
- Transformations and blending modes give you noise "vocabulary"
- Shape masks and color schemes provide spatial and frequency control

This controlled noise approach bridges the gap between the deterministic world of procedural generation and the probabilistic nature of diffusion models, offering creative control without sacrificing the generative AI's creative potential.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Add Node**: Add the `ShaderNoiseKSampler` node to your ComfyUI graph.
2.  **Connect Inputs**:
    -   `model`: Your primary AI model.
    -   `positive`, `negative`: Your conditioning prompts.
    -   `latent_image`: The input latent (e.g., from an Empty Latent Image node).
3.  **Basic Sampling Parameters**:
    -   Set `seed`, `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler`, and `denoise` as you would for a standard KSampler.
    -   It is recommended to use a fixed `seed` number when you want to explore the neighborhood around that specific seed. This allows the shader noise parameters to navigate the latent space coherently from a consistent starting point.
4.  **Configure Shader Noise**: This is where the exploration begins!
    -   **Stages**: Define `sequential_stages` and `injection_stages`.
    -   **Global Controls**: Set `shader_strength` (0.0 to disable shaders), `blend_mode`, and `noise_transform`.
    -   **Per-Stage Controls**: For each stage, configure:
        -   `shader_noise_type` (e.g., perlin, cellular)
        -   `noise_scale` (zoom control), `noise_octaves` (detail level), `noise_warp_strength` (non-linear navigation), `noise_phase_shift` (perspective shift)
        -   `shape_mask_type` and `shape_mask_strength`
        -   `color_scheme` and `color_intensity`
        -   Stage-specific `strength_multiplier`
    -   **Temporal Coherence**: Enable `use_temporal_coherence` for animations or consistent exploration.
5.  **Explore**: Use the "📊 Show Shader Matrix" button (or Alt+M) to better understand the noise patterns you're creating.
6.  **Generate**: Queue your prompt and witness the shader-guided generation!

> [!TIP]
> Start with a low `shader_strength` (e.g., 0.1-0.3) and a single `sequential_stage` to understand the impact of different noise types and parameters. Remember to use a fixed `seed` for neighborhood exploration. Gradually increase complexity as you become more familiar with how each parameter navigates the latent space.

## 🧠 Latent Space Navigation

Unlike random seed exploration, the ShaderNoiseKSampler provides a methodical way to navigate the latent space:

- **Creative Control vs. Serendipity**: Find a balance between intentional direction and unexpected discovery. You're not precisely controlling the output, but you're not completely at the mercy of randomness either - you're steering through possibility space.

- **Frequency Domain Exploration**: The mathematical nature of this tool allows you to explore how different frequency patterns map to semantic features in the generated images, revealing fundamental patterns in how visual information is encoded in the model.

- **Methodical Discovery**: As you experiment with different parameter combinations, you'll develop an intuitive understanding of how they affect the output, allowing for more deliberate creative choices.

- **Fine-Grained Control**: You can introduce a wide spectrum of changes, from barely noticeable subtleties to more significant transformations. This gives you the flexibility to choose your desired degree of alteration, all while preserving the core meaning, motion, and recognizable objects (semantic elements) of the image.

### Sampler & Scheduler Compatibility

Generally, `ShaderNoiseKSampler` aims for broad compatibility. The following are often good starting points (refer to the Shader Matrix for more details):

-   **Recommended Samplers**: `euler_ancestral`, `dpm_2_ancestral`, `dpmppm_2_ancestral`, `lcm`
-   **Recommended Schedulers**: `beta` (often preferred), `normal`, `simple`, `kl_optimal`

### 🧱 Model Compatibility

The `ShaderNoiseKSampler` also aims to be compatible with a variety of models. Compatibility often depends on the model's latent channel structure. The node attempts to automatically detect the channel count for many common models.

**Note on Channel Detection:** The `ShaderNoiseKSampler` includes logic to infer model channel counts (see `get_model_channel_count` in `shader_noise_ksampler.py`). If you encounter issues with a new or untested model, understanding its latent channel structure is important. For models with very high channel counts, performance or compatibility might vary, and specific noise generation approaches could be more suitable.

## 🔬 Shader Noise Deep Dive (Brief Overview)

The true depth of `ShaderNoiseKSampler` lies in its components. The "Shader Matrix" covers these extensively.

-   **Shader Noise Types**: Start your exploration with three powerful, freely available noise archetypes: `Domain Warp` for intricate, flowing distortions, `Tensor Field` for structured and directional patterns, and `Curl Noise` for smooth, fluid dynamics. Each offers a **unique visual lens** 🔭 for navigating latent space. ✨ **Additional advanced noise types** are available to supporters on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aemotionstudio).

**Domain Warp**

**Tensor Field**

**Curl Noise**

![Curl Noise Preview](https://github.com/AEmotionStudio/ComfyUI-ShaderNoiseKSampler/releases/download/assets-v1/curl_noise_preview.webp)

-   **Blend Modes**: Determine how the crafted shader noise interacts with the underlying base noise. `Multiply` can create depth, `Add` can introduce highlights, and `Overlay` can enhance contrast.
-   **Noise Transformations**: Apply mathematical functions like `absolute` (creates ridges), `sin` (creates bands), or `sqrt` (compresses highlights) to the raw shader noise before blending, dramatically altering its characteristics.
-   **Shape Masks**: Impose geometric forms onto your noise. A `radial` mask can create focus, a `grid` can introduce blocky structures. Strength is key.
-   **Color Schemes**: More than just a visual flair for the noise preview, these schemes (`viridis`, `inferno`, `jet`, etc.) transform the noise data itself. This "colored" noise can then guide the diffusion model in unique ways, influencing texture, features, and mood by altering how the model "perceives" the noise structure.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

-   **Shader Effects Not Visible**:
    -   Ensure `shader_strength` is greater than `0.0`.

-   **Unexpected Results**: Small parameter changes can sometimes lead to large visual shifts. Use the shader visualizer to understand the noise before generating. Experimentation is encouraged.

-   **Consult the Shader Matrix**: The in-app documentation is your best friend for detailed troubleshooting and understanding.

### Known Issues

-   **Optimal Use Cases**: The `ShaderNoiseKSampler` currently demonstrates its strongest capabilities in text-to-video and text-to-image generation. Performance with image-to-video or video-to-video workflows may not be as pronounced.

-   **Parameter Queuing with Non-Direct KSampler**: The standard (non-direct) `ShaderNoiseKSampler` node does not support queuing of differing parameter sets for consecutive runs i.e. you can't save over older parameters because their read at runtime. For rapid iteration and experimentation with varied parameters without needing to save each configuration, the `ShaderNoiseSampler (direct)` variant is recommended.

  > [!WARNING]
    **Potential for Visual Instability**: Certain parameter explorations, particularly with high intensity or complex interactions, may result in visually disruptive outputs such as flashing images or harsh artifacts. Users are advised to iterate with caution.

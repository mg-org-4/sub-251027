## Academia SD VL Model Loader (Qwen3-vl) & captions nodes

This set of nodes is designed to automate the process of image captioning and dataset preparation using Vision Language Models (VLM).
![](./assets/captions_wf.png)

### 1. AcademiaSD VLModel (Down)Loader
This node handles the acquisition and initialization of Vision Language Models directly from HuggingFace.
- **Inputs:**
  - `model_repo`: The HuggingFace repository ID (e.g., `huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-ablite`).
  - `low_vram`: Toggle to enable memory-efficient loading for GPUs with limited VRAM.
- **Outputs:**
  - `MODEL`: The loaded VLM model ready for inference.

### 2. AcademiaSD Captioner
The core engine for image interrogation. It uses the loaded model to analyze visual content based on a natural language prompt.
- **Inputs:**
  - `model`: Connection to the VLModel Loader.
  - `image`: The image to be analyzed.
  - `prompt`: Text instruction for the model (e.g., "Describe this image in detail").
  - `max_tokens`: Limit for the generated text length.
- **Outputs:**
  - `caption`: A string containing the generated description of the image.

### 3. Batch Image Loader (Dataset)
A specialized loader for dataset management that iterates through local directories.
- **Features:** It expects images to be named with consecutive numbering. You don't need to specify filenames, only the folder path and the current index.
- **Inputs:**
  - `folder_path`: Directory containing your dataset.
  - `image_index`: The specific number of the image to load.
- **Outputs:**
  - `image`: The loaded image tensor.
  - `image_path`: The full path string (essential for synchronization with the saver node).
  - `filename_text`: The name of the file being processed.

### 4. Counter (from file) & Reset Counter
A state-management system to track progress during batch processing.
- **Counter (from file):** Creates and updates a `loops.json` file in the ComfyUI `output` folder. It increments its value by 1 every time the workflow is executed. Perfect for driving the `image_index` of the Batch Loader.
- **Reset Counter (to file):** Contains a `trigger_reset` button that immediately sets the value in `loops.json` back to 0.

### 5. 💾 Save Dataset Caption (.txt)
Automates the creation of sidecar text files for model training datasets.
- **Features:** It uses the path from the Image Loader to ensure the `.txt` file is saved in the same location and with the same name as the image.
- **Inputs:**
  - `generated_caption`: The text from the Captioner.
  - `image_path`: Reference from the Loader to determine the save destination.
  - `extra_text`: Allows adding a "trigger word" or custom tags.
  - `text_position`: Choose if the trigger word appears as a Prefix (Start) or Suffix (End).
  - `separator`: Character used to separate the trigger word from the caption (e.g., a comma).
- **Outputs:**
  - `final_saved_text`: The complete string saved to the disk.

## Bypass nodes by value
This node acts as a central control hub to manage the execution state (Active vs. Bypass) of up to 5 connected nodes. It is especially useful for modular workflows where you want to toggle stages on or off dynamically.
![](./assets/bypasser.png)


- **How it works:**
    - **Manual Control:** You can manually toggle each connected node between `ON` and `BYPASS` using the individual switches in the UI.
    - **Sequential Control (`active_count`):** By connecting an integer to the `active_count` input, you can automate the bypass logic. For example, if `active_count` is set to 3, the first three connected nodes will be activated, and the rest will be bypassed automatically.
- **Features:**
    - **Dynamic Labels:** The switches in the node UI automatically rename themselves based on the title of the nodes connected to the inputs (`in1` to `in5`), making it easy to identify what you are controlling.
- **Inputs:**
    - `in1` to `in5`: Connect the nodes you wish to control here.
    - `active_count`: (Optional) Integer input to determine the number of nodes to keep active sequentially.

## 🖼️ Academia SD LTXV Multi-Frames
![Academia SD LTXV Multi-Frames](assets/LTXVMultiFrames.png)

An all-in-one, cable-free image injector designed specifically for LTX-Video Image-to-Video workflows.
*   **Drag & Drop Interface:** Upload and manage multiple reference images directly inside the node's UI. No need for messy `Load Image` nodes cluttering your workspace.
*   **Smart Indexing:** Automatically sets the first frame to index `0` and newly added frames to `-1` (last frame by default), keeping your animation loops mathematically sound.
*   **Per-Frame Strength Control:** Precisely adjust the injection strength for each individual keyframe to guide the video generation.
*   **In-Place Latent Injection:** Encodes and injects the images directly into the latent space and noise mask, perfectly conditioning the LTX-Video architecture without external spaghetti wiring.

> **Acknowledgments:** The core latent injection and masking logic of this node is built upon the fantastic work from [Kijai's ComfyUI-LTXVideo](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-LTXVideo) wrapper (specifically adapted from the `LTXVImgToVideoInplaceKJ` node).

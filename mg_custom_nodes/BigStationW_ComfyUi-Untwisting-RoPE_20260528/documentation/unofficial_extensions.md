# Unofficial Extensions

These options are experimental and are not part of the original Untwisting RoPE paper.

## `adain_on_v`

Extends AdaIN alignment from attention `Q/K` to also include `V`.

This can help ensure that the final image has a color scheme similar to that of the reference image.

## `post_attention_adain`

 Matches the target attention output statistics to the reference attention output.

This is borrowed from the [feature-injection idea in ConsiStory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03286).

Unlike ConsiStory, this implementation does not use masks or spatial correspondence maps. It uses a simpler global AdaIN match.

## `axis0_rope_mode`

The paper recommends setting the RoPE's axis 0 to a value equal to `low_scale` (uniform across all frequencies) for the only model they tested which was flux.1-dev. Perhaps this method works very well for that specific model, but for other models such as Z-Image Turbo, the result can be disastrous. It ends up amplifying the signal too much.

You have three choices:
- `default` -> As the paper intended
- `match_axes` -> axis0 ends up behaving exactly like the other axes (best results).
- `constant` -> You set up your own `axis0_rope_scale` value 

## `v_injection_strength`

Controls how much the target `V` tensor is directly blended toward the reference `V` tensor, forcing stronger texture/color/style transfer.

Gives pretty good results at low strength (~0.2).

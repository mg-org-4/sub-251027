Practical ComfyUI nodes for loading and resizing images, comparing video results, and building model workflows.

- **Prepare your media:** image loaders, Resize Box, and image/video comparison tools.
- **Build a generation workflow:** Ideogram, MiniMax H3, LTX, RTX video tools, and local LLM helpers.
- **Keep the canvas readable:** Visual Fold and optional Floating Tools.

[Quick Start](#quick-start) · [Browse Nodes](#included-nodes) · [Browser Tools](#web-tools) · [Latest Release](https://github.com/Deno2026/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/releases/latest) · [GPL-3.0-only](#license)

## Quick Start

Start with a working ComfyUI installation.

1. Open **ComfyUI Manager**, search for `Deno Custom Nodes`, and install the package.
2. Restart ComfyUI and refresh its browser page.
3. Double-click an empty area of the canvas, search for `(Deno) Resize Box`, and add it.
4. Add a standard `Load Image` node and choose an image. Connect it to Resize Box and connect Resize Box's `image` output to `Preview Image`. Choose a size and run the workflow to see your resized image.

This first example needs no generation model. Individual model and RTX nodes have their own requirements below. If you do not use Manager, see [manual installation](#install).

### Choose your next step

- **Prepare and compare:** start with [Resize Box](#deno-resize-box), [Multi Image Loader](#deno-multi-image-loader), or [Video Compare](#deno-video-compare).
- **Finish photos or video:** add [Film Grain](#deno-film-grain) after the final resize, before saving.
- **Generate with a model:** see [Ideogram Director](#deno-ideogram-director), [MiniMax H3](#deno-minimax-h3-multi-reference-image-loader), or [LTX Model Loader](#deno-ltx-model-loader).
- **Organize or work in a browser:** try [Visual Fold](#deno-visual-fold), [Floating Tools](#deno-floating-tools), or the no-install [Web Tools](#web-tools).

Most Deno nodes include a small green `i` button in the top-right corner for quick node info without leaving the ComfyUI canvas. If a newer Deno Custom Nodes version is available, the button turns yellow and shows a small `!` badge.
The pack also includes lightweight frontend/browser helpers such as **Deno Visual Fold**, optional **Deno Floating Tools** for Free VRAM, ComfyUI Stable update checks, and GPT/Gemini-ready Error Help reports, the no-install **Video Compare** page, the **Video to GIF/WebP** converter page, and the **Discord Media Compressor** page (Korean-only interface).

## Web Tools

Run these directly in your browser:

- [Deno Video Compare](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-compare/) - compare two rendered videos with slider, side-by-side, difference, and toggle views.
- [Deno Video to GIF/WebP](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-to-gif/) - trim, crop, resize, and export short clips as GIF or smaller WebP files.
- [Deno Discord Media Compressor](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-to-discord/) - compress videos or images for sharing on Discord, aiming for files below 10 MB when possible. The tool's interface is Korean-only.

## Deno Visual Fold

[Watch the Visual Fold demo (recorded with Korean browser controls)](docs/images/deno-visual-fold.webp).

Deno Visual Fold is a visual-only cleanup helper for large ComfyUI graphs. It is enabled automatically when the latest Deno Custom Nodes package is installed or updated.

Select two or more nodes and the native ComfyUI selection toolbar shows a readable green `Fold` badge. Click it to collapse the selected nodes into one compact visual group; use `Unfold` to restore them.

You can also select one normal ComfyUI group and use `Fold Group` to collapse the nodes inside that group while keeping the workflow logic untouched. When two or more groups are selected, the same toolbar adds readable `Align` badges for left/right/top/bottom alignment and horizontal/vertical spacing.

This is different from ComfyUI Subgraph. Subgraph moves nodes into a child graph, which can be powerful, but it may not be ideal when a workflow depends on keeping `Get` / `Set` nodes or parent-child graph structure visible in the main graph. Visual Fold is meant for simple visual organization only. It does not turn the selected nodes into a subgraph or change the workflow logic.

## Deno Floating Tools

Deno Floating Tools is an optional helper under `Settings > DENO > Tools`. It is off by default.

When enabled, it adds a small draggable Deno icon to the ComfyUI screen. The panel can free ComfyUI VRAM through ComfyUI's built-in memory cleanup endpoint, show read-only current/latest status for the ComfyUI Stable core release, and open an Error Help report when a run fails.

Error Help creates a GPT/Gemini-ready report with the current workflow, Python executable and environment type, package versions, GPU details, recent traceback/log context, and custom node summary. It is read-only, opens a report window first, and copies only when you click `Copy Report`. Common secrets such as tokens, cookies, passwords, private keys, and URL credentials are masked before copy.

Floating Tools does not install, update, restart, repair, or modify workflows.

## Deno Resource Monitor

Deno Resource Monitor adds compact CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM, and GPU temperature meters and a model/cache cleanup button to the ComfyUI top bar. The two features are independent and default to **Auto** under `Settings > DENO > Tools > Resource Monitor`.

The meters match Crystools' default horizontal appearance: 60 × 30 px bars, 5 px gaps, the same label/value placement and colors, and a temperature fill that changes from green to red. DENO's cleanup button stays alongside them; narrow windows use the separate compact row without moving existing toolbar controls.

| Existing setup | Resource meters in Auto | Cleanup button in Auto |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crystools loaded, existing full-cleanup button visible | Keep Crystools unchanged | Keep the existing button |
| Crystools loaded, full-cleanup button missing | Keep Crystools unchanged | Add only the DENO button |
| No Crystools, existing full-cleanup button visible | Add DENO meters | Add the DENO button; keep the existing button too |
| Neither available | Add DENO meters | Add the DENO button |

When Crystools is absent, the complete DENO bar (meters and cleanup button) is the default, regardless of other cleanup buttons. Only when Crystools is present does Auto use an existing visible full-cleanup button instead of adding DENO's. Explicit Off settings still take priority.

Auto leaves other extensions' settings, elements, and event handlers alone. It also respects Crystools that a user intentionally hid, and does not start DENO hardware polling while Crystools is registered. If extension detection fails, Auto conservatively withholds the meters. Desktop/portable labels and Manager startup flags alone do not decide the result: Crystools presence comes first, then the actual visible top bar. A model-unload-only button is not equivalent to full model-and-execution-cache cleanup.

`DENO resource monitor` offers `Auto / DENO / Off`; `DENO` explicitly replaces Crystools' meters. `DENO memory cleanup button` separately offers `Auto / Show / Off`. Set both to `Off` to disable both additions. Cleanup uses ComfyUI's built-in `/free` endpoint and is blocked when the queue is busy, its status is unknown, or manual unloading is disabled in ComfyUI settings. The notification acknowledges the request, not a guaranteed amount of released VRAM. It does not delete model files or disk caches.

GPU readings currently use NVIDIA NVML; unsupported or unavailable GPU fields are hidden, while CPU/RAM and cleanup remain usable. On multi-GPU systems the bar shows NVIDIA GPU index 0 (or the first available GPU), not necessarily the GPU selected for generation. The monitor samples only while its browser tab is visible and does not run a permanent broadcast thread. Button-only mode makes no DENO telemetry requests. Resource-monitor behavior and NVIDIA metric selection are adapted from MIT-licensed ComfyUI-Crystools; see [Third-Party Notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Drag the six-dot handle to move the DENO bar anywhere in the window. While dragging, a **Dock to top** target appears at its top-bar position; drop there to snap it back. The floating bar's rotation button switches between horizontal and vertical layouts while keeping labels upright. Position and orientation are remembered in this browser. Under `Settings > DENO > Tools > Resource Monitor`, `DENO resource monitor placement` offers `Top / Floating`, including a way to return a misplaced bar to the top.

The vertical layout is a 44px-wide rail, with small labels above centered tabular readings, smaller unit symbols, and thin usage lines. Its handle and cleanup/rotation buttons form one compact column for placing the monitor along a side of the canvas.

In Top mode, narrow or crowded windows move only the DENO controls to a compact row beneath the top bar; existing controls stay in place. Widening the window returns DENO to the top bar when there is room. Floating mode keeps the chosen position and fits the bar inside the window after resizing. Docking always displays a horizontal bar.

## Included Nodes

### `(Deno) Ideogram Director`

[![Watch the Ideogram Director workflow demo](docs/images/ideogram-director-video-thumbnail.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z8s27skkIDM)

Visual Ideogram 4 prompt builder for structured JSON captions and bbox layout work.

Main features:

- draw and edit bbox regions directly on the ComfyUI canvas
- temporarily disable individual bbox elements without deleting or reordering them
- double-click a bbox to edit beside the pointer, or repeatedly `Alt`+click an overlap to cycle through the boxes underneath
- import JSON prompts from a Local LLM Loader or other STRING source
- optionally connect Summary and Background STRING inputs to override those two board fields for a run; disconnected inputs continue to use the saved board text
- ask before replacing an existing board, or switch to always replace
- reject malformed JSON clearly instead of passing broken prompt text downstream
- style and layout preset galleries with lightweight preview thumbnails
- Language view for reading and editing board descriptions in your language while final output stays model-ready English. Literal TEXT box words such as signs, logos, and headlines are preserved exactly
- outputs: `prompt`, `width`, `height`, `seed`, `bboxes`
- the existing `bboxes` output connects to both standard `BBOX` consumers and `BOUNDING_BOX` inputs such as `Ideogram4_MultiLora_BoundingBoxNode_Fedor`; that node's region-row count follows the Director's active boxes without adding saved Director fields. Its current count-only synchronization does not track box identity, so review LoRA row assignments after deleting or reordering a middle box

### `(Deno) Resize Box`

Resolution helper and image resize node for ComfyUI.

![Deno Resize Box](docs/images/resize-box.jpg)

Main features:

- `Preset Ratio` and `Manual Input` modes
- common ratio presets
- megapixel-based size calculation
- `divisible_by` alignment
- `Center Crop (Fill)`, aspect-locked zoomable `Crop Position (Fill)`, and `Fit (Letterbox/Pillarbox)` resize modes
- `lanczos` default interpolation
- live ratio preview; `Crop Position (Fill)` shows the full connected source, lets you drag the crop box to reposition it, and lets you drag any corner to zoom while keeping the output ratio and megapixels fixed
- outputs: `image`, `width`, `height`

### `(Deno) Multi Image Loader`

Minor-upgrade multi-image loader designed for batch guide workflows.

Inspired by the original workflow ideas from **WhatDreamsCost**, then adapted and refined for the Deno workflow style.

![Deno Multi Image Loader](docs/images/multi-image-loader.jpg)

Main features:

- scrollable fixed-height gallery instead of endlessly growing node height
- drag reorder with stable placeholder insertion
- click thumbnails to disable/enable images without deleting them; only enabled images are output, numbered 1, 2, 3… in card order, with counts and numbers updating immediately
- disabled images and their positions remain saved with the workflow; enable at least one image to run
- upload button, drag-and-drop upload, and paste image support
- `Input Folder` browser for reusing existing ComfyUI `input` images
- input subfolder browsing with folder tiles, double-click navigation, and a `Parent` button
- nested input images can be added while preserving their ComfyUI subfolder paths
- external symlinks or junctions that leave ComfyUI's `input` folder are skipped for security; use `(Deno) Advanced Image Source Loader`'s External Folder mode for those sources
- newest-first input image sorting based on file modified time
- responsive input-folder thumbnails for smoother browsing with many images
- `Keep Input Ratio`, `Preset Ratio`, or `Manual Input` size mode
- ratio preset, megapixels, divisible-by sizing, or direct width/height control
- resize method and interpolation selection
- outputs: `multi_output`, `width`, `height`
- optional crop or fit resizing during export

### `(Deno) MiniMax H3 Multi Reference Image Loader`

Reference loader for MiniMax H3 workflows, with one-cable images and individual audio outputs.

Main features:

- the same upload, paste, drag-and-drop, Input Folder, card reorder, and clear workflow as `(Deno) Multi Image Loader`
- up to 9 ordered reference images through one dedicated socket
- keeps each decoded image's own dimensions and aspect ratio without resize, crop, pad, or letterbox processing
- displays each preview card at the source image's own aspect ratio, so mixed landscape and portrait references stay fully visible without preview cropping
- click thumbnails to disable/enable references; enabled cards are immediately renumbered to match `<Picture 1>`, `<Picture 2>`, and so on, and only those images reach both outputs
- disabled images stay saved in their card positions and still occupy one of the 9 gallery slots; enable at least one image or audio reference to run
- connects to the single `ref_images` input on `(Deno) MiniMax H3 Reference to Video`
- also exposes the same ordered sources as an `image_list` output that connects directly to `(Deno) Local LLM Loader`'s `image` input
- the H3 node keeps ComfyUI's native reference-video, paired-video-audio, and standalone-audio Autogrow inputs

The collapsible audio section below the image gallery accepts up to 3 audio files through `Add audio`, Input Folder, or file drop. Each file has a waveform, measured duration, preview playback, a separate Use toggle, reorder handle, and remove control. Playback does not change whether a file is used for generation. Video files are not accepted by this loader.

Each registered audio adds an individual `AUDIO` output after the two existing image outputs. Connect those outputs to `(Deno) MiniMax H3 Reference to Video`'s growing standalone-audio inputs and connect `audio_vae` to encode the sound. Only enabled audio cards receive `<Audio 1>`, `<Audio 2>`, and so on in card order. For example, with three registered files and the first two disabled, the third file is displayed and encoded as `<Audio 1>`. Disabled files and their cables remain saved; their ordinary downstream audio branches are skipped. Reordering keeps each cable attached to the same file, and removing a file removes only that file's audio cable. Audio-only loading is also supported.

The node grows automatically as audio files are added so every audio row stays visible without an internal scrollbar. Removing files or collapsing the audio section releases that space. Manually added height and width are preserved, and reopening an older compact workflow expands it enough to show its saved audio rows.

To keep the displayed tags and H3 references identical, connect all enabled audio outputs from one DENO loader to the same DENO H3 node. Turn off files you do not want to connect. When using these DENO audio outputs, other standalone-audio sources and reference-video soundtracks must be disconnected from that H3 node; the node explains a numbering conflict instead of silently assigning different tags. Existing workflows that use only other audio loaders retain their stock input behavior.

Audio files are read from ComfyUI's input folder. Supported extensions are WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG/OGA, Opus, M4A, AAC, AIF and AIFF, subject to the installed PyAV decoder. Loading is bounded to 256 MiB per file, 128 MiB decoded PCM, and 30 seconds of CPU decoding. Preview failures have a Retry action and do not change the saved files or their connections.

The dedicated H3 socket is intentional: a normal ComfyUI `IMAGE` batch requires one shared width and height, so it cannot preserve mixed reference sizes. The additional `image_list` is a list output rather than a same-size batch, so the original dimensions, order, and aspect ratios remain separate when reused by list-aware nodes. MiniMax H3 may still downscale references during its normal `ref_image_size` processing while preserving their aspect ratio.

On ComfyUI builds that support optional H3 VAEs, `(Deno) MiniMax H3 Reference to Video` also accepts an unconnected `vae` or `audio_vae` input. Connecting both keeps the existing reference-encoding behavior.

- Without `vae`, reference images and videos still reach the text/vision encoder, but their VAE-encoded reference latents are omitted.
- Without `audio_vae`, the actual reference sound is not encoded. The text encoder retains labels such as `<Audio 1>`, not the audio waveform; connect `audio_vae` to reference a voice or sound. Omitting it does not disable generated audio.

Audio paired with a reference video (`ref_video_audio`) needs both `vae` and `audio_vae` connected to encode the reference video and its sound; standalone reference audio (`ref_audio`) needs only `audio_vae`.

These choices apply only to reference encoding in this node. Keep the VAEs needed by the downstream video and audio decoding nodes. Older ComfyUI builds whose native H3 node requires both VAEs still require both connections; update ComfyUI to use optional reference encoding.

These two MiniMax H3 nodes require ComfyUI 0.30.0 or newer. See the portable [MiniMax H3 multi-reference workflow](docs/workflows/minimax-h3-multi-reference.json) for the complete native H3 pipeline with the two stock `Load Image` nodes replaced by the one-cable Deno loader.

### `(Deno) MiniMax H3 Acc LoRA Loader`

Directly loads Alibaba PAI's official [MiniMax-H3-Acc-LoRAs](https://huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/MiniMax-H3-Acc-LoRAs) without converting or duplicating the safetensors file.

1. Download the official FL2VA or Ref2VA `Acc-8Step.safetensors` file and place it in either the normal `ComfyUI/models/loras/` folder or the dedicated `ComfyUI/models/minimax_h3_acc_loras/` folder.
2. Connect a matching native MiniMax H3 diffusion model to `model`; full and Comfy-Org `*_pruned_*` variants are accepted.
3. Select the matching Acc-LoRA: FL2VA for FL2VA/T2VA, or Ref2VA for Ref2VA.
4. Connect this node's single `model` output to the normal guider path.
5. Build the sampling lane with stock ComfyUI nodes. The recommended starting point is `BasicScheduler: simple, steps: 8` and `KSamplerSelect: euler`, connected to `SamplerCustomAdvanced`.

The node applies the static LoRA weights and the checkpoint's 32 time-dependent PDD output heads. At sampling time it reads the actual sigma boundaries supplied by ComfyUI and automatically fuses the PDD heads for those intervals. This keeps sampler, scheduler, and step controls in the normal ComfyUI nodes. The official 8-step Simple/Euler setup remains the recommended and trained configuration; users can select any Simple Scheduler step count from 4 through 12 without changing this loader, and other descending schedules or split sigma passes for latent-upscale workflows remain available for experimentation rather than guaranteed quality improvements. Keep the native MiniMax H3 video/audio sigma shifts at `12.0 / 3.0` and LoRA strength at `1.0`.

Full non-pruned models, including native ComfyUI INT8 variants, apply the complete adapter through ComfyUI's normal quantization-aware LoRA path. For a curve-pruned model, the loader looks for a matching non-pruned MiniMax H3 checkpoint already present under `models/diffusion_models/`, reads only its small FP32 time-embedder section, and derives an in-memory bridge that rebases all 50 full-width AdaLN LoRA updates onto the pruned 8-wide curve. It never loads the full checkpoint for this calculation. If no matching full checkpoint is installed, the loader remains usable in compatibility mode: it warns once, skips those 50 AdaLN updates, and still applies every other LoRA update and the PDD heads.

Standard active UI workflows saved with the v0.7.92-v0.7.94 three-output loader are migrated when loaded on the ComfyUI canvas. Existing model links stay in place, and the former sampler and sigmas links move to editable stock `KSamplerSelect: euler` and `BasicScheduler: simple, steps: 8` nodes. Save the UI workflow once after it opens. Current single-output workflows are not changed. Muted/bypassed nodes, unknown customized layouts, and malformed graphs are left untouched rather than guessed. Raw API prompt JSON does not run this frontend migration; export it again from the migrated UI workflow. If a file was already saved after its former sampler/sigmas links disappeared, reconnect those stock nodes manually.

LoRA weights and workflows are not bundled with Deno Custom Nodes. Download the weights from Alibaba and build or adapt your own native ComfyUI workflow.

### MiniMax H3 R2V Audio Reference workflow

The [beginner audio-reference workflow](docs/workflows/minimax-h3-r2v-audio-reference.json) keeps ComfyUI's stock MiniMax H3 reference-audio path and adds an automatic prompt-direction lane:

- `(Deno) Audio Transcript` uses local OpenAI Whisper for lyrics or dialogue, segment timing, detected language, and a confidence summary. Optional user-entered lyrics remain the wording authority.
- `(Deno) Audio Analysis Finalizer` keeps only the documented acoustic-analysis fields from ComfyUI's `TextGenerate` result and can unload that CLIP model after the analysis.
- `(Deno) Local LLM Loader` receives the transcript and acoustic report through its optional `audio_context` STRING input. Raw AUDIO is not sent to the local LLM, and upstream analysis is treated as data rather than instructions.
- The selected source-audio section is both H3's `<Audio 1>` reference and the audio muxed into the final MP4. H3's internally generated audio is not decoded in this workflow.

Requirements:

- current ComfyUI Stable with MiniMax H3 and audio-capable `TextGenerate` support
- [ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) for `Load Audio (Upload)`
- `gemma4_e4b_it_fp8_scaled.safetensors` in `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders/` for acoustic analysis
- LM Studio with `google/gemma-4-12b-qat` loaded and its Local Server running for the final prompt-director step

`openai-whisper` is installed as a node dependency. The selected Whisper checkpoint downloads from OpenAI on the first `(Deno) Audio Transcript` run, is checksum-validated by the official Whisper loader, and is cached under `ComfyUI/models/stt/whisper/`.

### `(Deno) Text Encoder Unload`

An opt-in inline VRAM barrier for the common positive-only or positive/negative prompt flow.

![Deno Text Encoder Unload workflow](docs/images/text-encoder-unload-workflow.png)

- connect positive conditioning through `Positive Conditioning`; it is required and passes through unchanged
- optionally connect an encoded negative prompt or `Conditioning Zero Out` through `Negative Conditioning`; it also passes through unchanged
- connect the exact `CLIP` used by the upstream text encoders to `Text Encoder (CLIP)`
- leave `Negative Conditioning` empty for a positive-only guider workflow
- unload only that CLIP/text encoder, its clones, and its managed components through ComfyUI model management; diffusion models, VAEs, and ControlNets are not globally unloaded
- follow normal ComfyUI input caching, so unchanged preview sampling can be reused while changed conditioning or CLIP paths still trigger the unload

Dynamic VRAM moves weights according to memory pressure and may intentionally leave text-encoder pages resident. This node provides a deterministic opt-in release point, but it cannot make the whole process use `0 MiB`: CUDA context, conditioning tensors, other models, custom-node allocations, and other applications remain separate. It also does not improve sampling quality by itself; it creates VRAM headroom that can reduce model offloading or avoid an out-of-memory error. A later text encode must reload the model, and `--gpu-only` cannot move the encoder out of VRAM.

### `(Deno) Advanced Image Source Loader`

Advanced image source loader for workflows that need external folders, local file paths, web image URLs, and mixed-size image-list output.

This is a separate advanced node. The standard `(Deno) Multi Image Loader` remains the simpler recommended option for normal ComfyUI `input` folder workflows.

![Deno Advanced Image Source Loader](docs/images/advanced-image-source-loader.png)

Main features:

- keeps the familiar Deno image-loader gallery workflow
- supports existing ComfyUI `input` folder browsing
- supports external local folder paths outside the ComfyUI `input` folder
- supports folder tiles, nested-folder browsing, and a `Parent` button
- supports `URL / Path` input for web image URLs, absolute local image paths, and local folder paths
- web thumbnails use the same validated server fetch as execution; quoted paths from Windows `Copy as path` are also recognized for previews
- use `Refresh previews` to retry thumbnails without changing sources, enabled state, or order; hover a failed preview for help
- external local file previews require a localhost connection to ComfyUI
- web image URLs use direct HTTP(S) connections to public addresses; private addresses and environment-proxy routing are not supported
- supports upload, drag-and-drop, paste, and browser folder upload where the browser allows it
- includes a visible `Paste` button plus normal Ctrl+V image paste
- click thumbnails to disable/enable sources without deleting them
- disabled sources stay readable and remain saved with the workflow until re-enabled or removed
- only enabled cards receive sequential output numbers; toggling or reordering updates those numbers immediately
- drag thumbnail cards to reorder output sequence
- the gallery follows the node's available height in both the classic canvas and Nodes 2.0
- thumbnails use a masonry-style flow so mixed portrait/landscape references are easier to scan
- `Load Path` reads an external folder directly without first importing it into ComfyUI `input`
- `Upload Folder...` is an optional browser upload/import helper, not required for external path loading
- `recursive_folders` option for loading nested folder images
- `Keep Input Ratio`, `Preset Ratio`, or `Manual Input` size mode
- ratio preset, megapixels, divisible-by sizing, or direct width/height control
- resize method and interpolation selection, including center, top, or bottom crop fill modes
- optional `images` input can chain an upstream image batch/list into the same output stream
- outputs a resized `batch` image tensor for normal batch workflows
- outputs `image_list` for workflows that need per-image list handling
- `Original Size` list mode can preserve mixed source resolutions in `image_list`
- `Match Batch Size` list mode makes `image_list` match the resized batch dimensions
- outputs: `batch`, `image_list`, `width`, `height`, `image_count`

### `(Deno) Film Grain`

Adds monochrome film grain to a photo or a decoded video `IMAGE` batch using CPU processing. No model or additional package installation is needed. The default blends fine and coarse grain at 75:25, softens extreme particles, and reduces grain near pure black and white. Only the grain pattern is blurred; image detail is preserved.

![Film Grain controls](docs/images/film-grain.png)

The panel uses English controls and the compact green styling of the other Deno nodes, regardless of ComfyUI's locale. It shows **Strength**, **Grain size**, **Roughness**, **Tone protection** and one **Processing** choice. **Strength runs from 0 to 1**: the selected default `0.50` matches code amount `6`, while `1.00` matches amount `12`. **Low RAM** (default) processes one frame at a time, **Balanced** uses two, and **Faster** uses four. The grain output is identical; faster processing can use more temporary RAM. **Frames at once** under **Advanced** provides the exact 1–4 value, including a preserved custom value of 3. Processing uses CPU and does not change upstream generation VRAM or split saved video into clips. The complete output frame batch still needs RAM; see the Processing tooltip. Seed and video chunk settings are also under Advanced.

Existing workflows retain their saved values and cables. A saved amount above the panel's new maximum remains intact until you deliberately adjust the slider. Connected parameter inputs control their respective settings; the panel disables those controls and keeps their native sockets visible.

New nodes default to **Advanced → Grain scale → Match resolution**. Grain size is relative to the frame: the node creates the original grain on an aspect-matched grid with a **1536px shorter edge** (the selected 2752×1536 reference), then resamples only that monochrome grain to the input size. Strength and the fine/coarse mix are unchanged. At 2752×1536 the result is exactly the original preset. Existing saved workflows retain **Fixed pixels** and their previous result; choose Match resolution to enable the new behavior. Older API prompts that omit `grain_scale_mode` also retain the pixel-based result.

The reference pattern is filtered when sampled into smaller frames, rather than amplified back to the same per-pixel variance. This keeps particle size and visible strength more consistent when different resolutions are viewed at the same display size. Very fine grain, codec compression and playback scaling can still differ; identical appearance in every player is not guaranteed. Extremely stretched inputs whose reference grid exceeds 16,777,216 pixels fail before allocating it and can use Fixed pixels instead.

Connect it at the end of the image processing chain:

- Photo: final image / resize → **Film Grain** → **Save Image**.
- Native video: decoded frames / final resize → **Film Grain** → **Create Video** → **Save Video**. Keep the original audio and frame rate connected to Create Video.
- Video Helper Suite: decoded frames → **Film Grain** → **Video Combine**. Keep its audio and frame-rate settings.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | on | Off passes through the original input without copying. |
| `amount` | `6` | Stored/API strength in 8-bit brightness units. Panel strength `0.5` = amount `6`, `1` = amount `12`; `0` passes through. The larger backend range retains older workflows. |
| `grain_size` | `1` | Relative fine/coarse size in Match resolution; original `0.45 / 1.15 px` sigma at the 1536px reference. Fixed pixels uses these sigmas at the input resolution. |
| `roughness` | `0.25` | Coarse grain proportion; default fine/coarse mix `75:25`. |
| `tone_weighted` | on | Emphasizes darker midtones and protects the brightest and darkest ends. |
| `temporal_mode` | `changing` | Varies the pattern per frame. `fixed` repeats a pattern for comparison. |
| `seed` | `2026100701` | Reproduces the same pattern and frame sequence. |
| `frame_offset` | `0` | First frame's global index when processing video chunks separately. |
| `processing_batch_size` | `1` | Frames processed together on CPU, from 1 to 4. 1 minimizes temporary RAM. |
| `grain_scale_mode` | `resolution` for new nodes | Match resolution samples the reference grain into the frame. `pixels` preserves the original pixel-based grain; omission in old API prompts uses `pixels`. |

To compare settings with the same pattern across runs, keep `seed` unchanged and set ComfyUI's seed **control after generate** to `fixed`.

Scratch memory is limited to the selected processing group (1–4 frames), and enabled output is stored on CPU rather than allocating a second full batch in VRAM. Match resolution also needs the reference grain grid, so lower-resolution frames can use more temporary RAM than Fixed pixels; Low RAM keeps this work to one frame at a time. **The complete output IMAGE batch still requires RAM**, in addition to the upstream input and ComfyUI caches. For float32 RGB, this output uses `frames × width × height × 12` bytes: about **23.7 MiB per 1080p frame**, or **2.78 GiB for 120 frames**. This node does not stream an entire video file or remove upstream cache memory; use shorter batches for long or high-resolution clips. Disabled/zero-strength runs return the same input object.

Size, channel count and dtype are preserved; RGBA alpha is unchanged. The node operates on pixels, while Save Image/Save Video retain responsibility for workflow metadata, encoding and file creation. A native `VIDEO` socket connects after Create Video, not directly to this node. Video compression may soften fine grain or increase the saved file size.

### `(Deno) Image Compare`

Visual A/B comparison node for quickly checking two images on the ComfyUI canvas.

![Deno Image Compare](docs/images/image-compare.jpg)

Main features:

- compares `image_a` and `image_b` directly inside the node
- modes: `Slider`, `Side by Side`, `Difference`, and `Toggle`
- hover-move slider interaction for fast before/after inspection
- visible A/B labels and a `Swap` button for checking either direction
- resizes the internal preview area with the node so portrait and landscape images stay readable
- visual-only node with no output connection, keeping the graph cleaner when the comparison is just for inspection

### `(Deno) Video Compare`

Visual A/B comparison node for videos, built for checking upscale and FPS-interpolation results directly on the ComfyUI canvas. All compositing is pure tensor work — no external encoder. The in-node player draws a downscaled WebP frame sequence on a `<canvas>` on a virtual clock (so A/B stay frame-exact) and plays audio via WebAudio; the files are written to ComfyUI's temp dir and served by the existing `/view` route, then auto-cleared on restart.

Main features:

- `video_a` / `video_b` (IMAGE batches) and optional `audio_a` / `audio_b` (AUDIO, e.g. from VHS *Load Video*)
- modes: `Slider`, `Side by Side`, `Difference`, `Toggle` (freeze-frame A/B flip), plus `Swap`
- hover-move slider, click = play/pause, scrub bar, frame step, speed, loop; hover the preview to hear the selected side
- shared timeline: input A's frame count and selected FPS define the duration (B is used if A is absent). Both preview sides and the saved output use this duration, including after `Swap`; B is sampled across its full sequence to match A's output frame count. An FPS-interpolation result can still look smoother in the preview at the same length.
- node resizes to the clip aspect; wheel and middle-drag are passed to the ComfyUI canvas
- `🏷 Output Badges` toggle: optionally adds A/B + resolution badges to the saved output (off by default; the in-node preview always shows them)
- `comparison`: full-resolution **lossless** IMAGE output of the chosen mode (Slider / Side by Side / Difference / Toggle), ready to wire into a save/encode node such as VHS *Video Combine* at the selected FPS. `Toggle` outputs the selected A/B side throughout the sequence.

Too heavy to run the node? Use the no-install browser tool: **https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-compare/** (also linked at the bottom of the node).

![Deno Video Compare - Side by Side](docs/images/video-compare-sbs.png)

![Deno Video Compare - Difference](docs/images/video-compare-diff.png)

### `(Deno) Video Preview`

Drop-in, full-resolution preview for checking real encoded output at any point in a graph. It encodes the actual H.264 video at the original resolution in-process with PyAV (no external process is launched) using `+faststart` so the browser plays it inline reliably, then passes the images straight through — so you can insert it **inline at multiple sampling points** without branching the wire.

Main features:

- `images` (IMAGE batch) in, `images` straight-through out, `frame_rate`, and an optional `audio` input that is muxed into the preview as AAC (tolerant of dict / object / `(waveform, sr)` AUDIO and `[C,N]` / `[N,C]` shapes; if audio can't be used it is logged and the video still previews)
- clean auto-looping in-node player like the VHS preview: no control chrome, **hover to hear audio**, **click = play/pause**, a **Full screen** button, and the wheel is passed through to the ComfyUI canvas
- a compact top-left info badge shows the current preview's resolution, FPS, frame count, and duration
- the node fits the clip aspect and stays fitted as it is resized
- each node reuses one temp file, overwritten every run, so heavy iteration never piles up temp storage
- needs PyAV (`pip install av`); if it is missing the node shows a clear one-line install hint instead of failing the graph

### `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution`

Optional Windows/NVIDIA RTX Video Super Resolution helper node for users who want to try NVIDIA VFX inside ComfyUI without manually hunting for the right Python environment.

This node is intentionally separate from the core Deno nodes. It only imports NVIDIA VFX during upscale execution, so normal Deno node installs do not require NVIDIA VFX. ComfyUI Manager installs the node pack without auto-installing NVIDIA VFX.

![Deno RTX Video Super Resolution](docs/images/rtx-vfx-easy-upscale-node.png)

Beginner install flow:

1. Install or update `deno-custom-nodes`, then start ComfyUI.
2. Add `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution` and run it once with an image.
3. If NVIDIA VFX is missing, close every ComfyUI window/process.
4. Click the node's `How to install` button.
5. Follow the visual web install guide: download the ZIP from that page, move it into `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\deno-custom-nodes\tools`, extract it there, and run `install_rtx_vfx.bat` from the extracted installer files inside that `tools` folder.
6. If the BAT asks `Install RTX VFX here?`, type `Y` only when the shown Windows path is inside the ComfyUI app you just closed. If it looks wrong, type `N` and stop.
7. Wait for the green `INSTALL COMPLETE` message.
8. Restart ComfyUI completely, then use `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution` again.

For the full beginner-friendly visual walkthrough, open the [Deno RTX VFX install page](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/rtx-vfx-install/).
If a tutorial video tells you to open the `tools` folder after installing from ComfyUI Manager, open `tools/OPEN_INSTALL_GUIDE.txt`; it points to the same current install page.

Official NVIDIA references:

- [Video Super Resolution filter](https://docs.nvidia.com/maxine/vfx/latest/Filters/VideoSuperResolution.html)
- [NVIDIA VFX Python bindings](https://docs.nvidia.com/maxine/vfx-python/latest/index.html)
- [VideoSuperRes Python API](https://docs.nvidia.com/maxine/vfx-python/latest/api.html)

Mode guide:

| If your image is... | Use |
| --- | --- |
| small, low-res, or compressed | `VSR` |
| already clean, but needs a larger sharper output | `High Bitrate` |
| noisy or grainy | `Denoise` |
| soft, out of focus, or mildly blurred | `Deblur` |

Main features:

- uses NVIDIA's official `nvidia-vfx` / `nvvfx.VideoSuperRes` package path
- links from the node UI to NVIDIA's official Video Super Resolution documentation
- shows a compact RTX panel with effect buttons, a separate quality selector, a mode-coach line, and only the resize controls that apply to the selected effect
- single-pass and 2-pass RTX panels pass mouse-wheel scrolling through to the ComfyUI canvas, so normal canvas zoom still works while the pointer is over the node
- installer targets the Python used by the current ComfyUI install
- installer refuses to continue if ComfyUI is still running with that Python
- installer asks before installing into the detected Python
- installer stops if no NVIDIA GPU is detected unless the user explicitly overrides the check
- installer reinstalls `nvidia-vfx` cleanly when the user confirms the target Python
- installer first verifies the normal `nvvfx` package path used by the current ComfyUI Python
- installer uses the ASCII Windows runtime fallback only when the normal `nvvfx` path fails verification
- node startup prefers the recorded ASCII fallback path only when that fallback was actually selected
- if another NVIDIA VFX native module is already loaded from a conflicting path, the node stops and asks for a full ComfyUI restart instead of trying to reload the native extension
- installer verifies that NVIDIA's `VideoSuperRes` effect can actually be created after install
- if NVIDIA VFX reports an unsupported runtime feature, the node shows a readable GPU/driver/runtime-path message instead of a raw stack trace
- if NVIDIA Broadcast/NGX VFX DLLs from another RTX node are already loaded, the node reports that native runtime conflict separately from GPU/driver support
- if another Broadcast-based RTX node works while Deno fails, treat it as a native runtime conflict, not proof that the Deno install is broken
- keeps the installer BAT and ZIP on GitHub instead of inside the Manager package, while the node UI provides a `How to install` button that opens the visual web install page plus a `Copy steps` helper
- keeps a small `tools/OPEN_INSTALL_GUIDE.txt` file in Manager installs so the `tools` folder still exists for users following older tutorial videos
- exposes four clear effect buttons: Video SR, High Bitrate, Denoise, and Deblur
- shows a compact mode coach line that explains the selected effect in plain language
- keeps Low, Medium, High, and Ultra quality as a separate selector
- for Video SR and High Bitrate, supports `Scale`, `Keep Ratio`, `Manual`, and `Preset Ratio` resize choices
- `Keep Ratio` and `Preset Ratio` use target megapixels; `Manual` uses width and height
- exposes `divisible_by` alignment for resizable modes, with `1` as the default so standard video sizes such as 1920x1080 stay exact
- higher alignment values such as `32` remain available when a workflow specifically needs forced multiple-of-N output
- shows `Center Crop (Fill)` / `Fit (Letterbox/Pillarbox)` when a manual, preset-ratio, or aligned keep-ratio resize can change aspect ratio
- `Denoise` and `Deblur` keep the original size and hide resize controls, matching NVIDIA's same-size VSR modes
- shows resize controls only when they apply to the selected effect
- Easy Upscale outputs: `images`
- The node shows controls only. Connect its `images` output to Preview Image or Image Compare to view the processed result.

### `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution (2 Pass)`

Two-pass RTX finishing node for full video workflows. It can run an optional same-size `Denoise` or `Deblur` pass first, then an optional `VSR` or `High Bitrate` upscale pass.

Example workflow:

- [RTX 2-pass upscale workflow](docs/workflows/deno-rtx-lowram-metabatch.json)

Main features:

- includes both `Low System Memory` and `High System Memory` lanes in the example workflow
- the low-memory lane uses VHS Meta Batch so longer videos can be processed in smaller frame chunks
- uses `VHS_VideoInfoSource` to carry the source FPS into `VHS_VideoCombine`
- preserves source audio through the VHS load/combine path
- useful when finishing actual encoded video outputs, not just testing a single image batch
- outputs: `images`

### `(Deno) LTX Sequencer`

LTX guide sequencer tuned for multi-image workflows.

Inspired by **WhatDreamsCost**'s LTX workflow approach, with Deno-side adjustments focused on day-to-day usability.

![Deno LTX Sequencer](docs/images/ltx-sequencer.jpg)

Main features:

- works with the batch output from `(Deno) Multi Image Loader`
- auto-fills `num_images` from the connected loader when possible
- keeps the existing sync-style workflow
- allows only `strength` values to break out into manual control when needed
- `bypass` switch passes `positive`, `negative`, and `latent` through unchanged for quick A/B tests

### `(Deno) LTX Model Loader`

One compact loader for the common LTX 2.3 model-loading patterns.

![Deno LTX Model Loader](docs/images/ltx-model-loader.jpg)

Main features:

- `Checkpoint Style`, `KJ Style`, and `GGUF Style` modes
- outputs: `model`, `clip`, `video_vae`, `audio_vae`
- uses ComfyUI's built-in checkpoint / diffusion / DualCLIP loading paths where possible
- uses KJNodes `VAELoaderKJ` for split video/audio VAE workflows
- uses ComfyUI-GGUF UNet loading for GGUF workflows
- includes clearer dependency errors and an audio VAE compatibility fallback for mixed ComfyUI/KJNodes environments

### `(Deno) LTX Tiled Spatial Upscaler`

Helper for high-resolution LTX video-latent second passes. It splits each frame into overlapping spatial tiles, runs the LTX latent spatial upscaler per tile, and blends the result back into one latent.

Use it on video-only LTX latents. If your workflow carries combined video/audio latents, separate the audio path first and rejoin it after the tiled video pass.

### `(Deno) LTX High resolution Tiled Sampler`

Sampler for high-resolution LTX AV refinement passes. It keeps one global sampler trajectory while video predictions are evaluated through overlapping spatial tiles and fused before the sampler update.

The full audio latent is passed to every video tile as context, while the returned audio latent is kept unchanged in `freeze` mode.

### `(Deno) Easy Model Download Helper`

Preset-based setup helper for recommended model file sets. The built-in presets cover the LTX 2.3 8GB VRAM GGUF starter set and the official LTX 2.5 Distilled INT8 two-stage model set.

![Deno Easy Model Download Helper](docs/images/easy-model-download-helper.png)

Main features:

- opens official model links in the browser instead of downloading files in Python
- includes the LTX 2.5 diffusion model, projected Gemma 4 text encoder, video and audio VAEs, and x2 spatial upscaler required by the two-stage workflow
- shows detected ComfyUI model roots and lets users copy the selected root
- supports saved creator presets inside the workflow and restores them from browser storage after a page reload
- supports Hugging Face direct links and Civitai page/download links without Python-side network requests
- checks ComfyUI-registered model folders, including custom folder names from `extra_model_paths`
- checks each preset's exact target path inside those registered model folders without scanning unrelated nested project folders
- shows target ComfyUI model subfolders so viewers know exactly where files should go

The LTX 2.5 repository requires a Hugging Face account and **Agree and Access** before its files can be downloaded. The helper does not bypass that gate or download files automatically. Review the [LTX-2 Community License](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/LICENSE.md), request access on the [official LTX 2.5 repository](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.5), then use the helper's browser links and move each downloaded file into the displayed ComfyUI model folder.

Creator preset link guide:

- Hugging Face: right-click the small download icon next to the target file, choose `Copy link address`, then paste that direct file URL into the preset `URL` field.
- Civitai: copy the model page URL from the browser address bar, paste it into the preset `URL` field, then press the `Civitai` button in the editor to convert it to a direct browser download link. If the filename is not visible in the URL, enter the downloaded filename manually.
- For Civitai pages, do not copy the blue `Download` button link unless you intentionally want to provide a direct API download URL.
- `File name` is used only for the target-path check. It should match the downloaded file on disk, especially for Civitai/API links.

![Civitai preset editor guide](docs/images/easy-model-download-helper-civitai-node.png)

### `(Deno) Multi LoRA Loader`

General-purpose multi LoRA loader for ordinary ComfyUI diffusion workflows.

Main features: apply up to eight LoRAs to a connected `MODEL` and optional `CLIP`, enable or disable each saved slot without losing its selection, set separate model and CLIP strengths, keep trigger words and notes beside each LoRA, reorder slots, and pass the patched `model` and `clip` downstream.

### `(Deno) LTX Multi LoRA Loader`

Power-LoRA-style multi LoRA loader for LTX workflows.

![Deno LTX Multi LoRA Loader](docs/images/ltx-multi-lora-loader.png)

Main features:

- add multiple LoRAs in one compact node
- per-slot enable toggle
- per-slot `strength`, `video`, and `audio` strength controls
- per-slot trigger word and LoRA note editor
- copy saved trigger words from the LoRA row
- outputs patched `model` and `clip`
- designed to stay close to the familiar Power LoRA Loader workflow while adding LTX-friendly A/V controls and lightweight LoRA reference notes

### `(Deno) LTX Prompt Guide`

Prompt helper that combines LTX prompt encoding, optional negative prompt handling, built-in LTX conditioning, and dialogue-length planning.

![Deno LTX Prompt Guide](docs/images/ltx-prompt-guide.png)

Main features:

- positive prompt text encoding
- optional collapsible negative prompt
- built-in LTX conditioning with `frame_rate`
- estimates minimum video length from quoted dialogue
- supports Auto, Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese dialogue estimates
- outputs: `positive`, `negative`, `frame_rate`

### `(Deno) Bernini Prompt Guide`

KJ-style Bernini prompt helper that combines positive and negative prompt encoding into one beginner-friendly node.

[Bernini Prompt Guide screenshot (includes a Chinese negative-prompt example)](docs/images/bernini-prompt-guide.jpg).

Main features:

- `System Prompt` selector with readable modes such as `Text to Video`, `Image to Video`, and `Reference Video Edit`
- shows the active system prompt prefix directly on the top of the node
- writes prompts in instruction style, for example `Replace the jacket with the shirt from image0. Keep the camera motion, background, lighting, and shadows unchanged.`
- reference modes automatically add a short `image0`, `image1`, `image2` naming hint internally
- collapsible negative prompt section
- negative presets fill the visible negative prompt box; edit that box directly to change the final encoded negative prompt
- outputs: `positive`, `negative`

This node prepares text conditioning only. Connect its `positive` and `negative` outputs to ComfyUI Stable's native `(Bernini) Conditioning` node for Bernini visual/context-latent conditioning. Current ComfyUI includes the [merged native Bernini backend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/pull/14216), so the old preview-backend updater is no longer required; update ComfyUI Stable if the native conditioning node is missing.

### `(Deno) Prompt Text`

A small multiline STRING source for system prompts, user prompts, templates, or JSON text. Use it when a long reusable prompt should stay readable in its own node and connect into Ideogram Director, Local LLM Loader, or another STRING input without changing the text.

### `(Deno) Local LLM Loader` and `(Deno) Local LLM Reviewer`

Local LLM workflow helpers for calling models that are already running on your PC and using text reviews to control what gets saved.

Main features:

- call local Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, Custom OpenAI-compatible, llama-swap, or Unsloth Studio models from ComfyUI
- localhost-by-default server safety: use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, or explicitly allow one private LAN `IP:port` with `DENO_LOCAL_LLM_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- refresh provider-specific model lists from the node
- keeps one detected-model selector across repeated refreshes and provider changes, and removes known duplicate selectors from older frontend sessions while preserving the selected model
- stop a running local LLM request before unloading the model
- use llama-swap's live running-state and management APIs for manual or post-run unload; any configured llama-swap server timeout still owns automatic unloading
- use the `Unsloth` provider only with an Unsloth Studio server (default `http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1`); if an Unsloth GGUF is running inside LM Studio, select `LM Studio` instead
- list Unsloth Studio models, send OpenAI-compatible chat requests without tool-definition or tool-choice fields, and use Unsloth Studio's management API for manual or post-run unload; `Keep for minutes` does not schedule a timed Unsloth unload
- connect prompt batches through one node run so the local model can stay loaded until the batch finishes
- optionally attach an IMAGE to a vision-capable local model call
- preview Thinking and Result text directly on the node
- embed the node's final Result in saved PNG/workflow metadata whenever the Local LLM node executes, so reopening the file restores it inside the node; Thinking/reasoning remains preview-only and is not persisted
- keep named System Prompt presets in ComfyUI user data so they survive browser-profile cleanup; existing browser presets can be imported once while the browser copy stays untouched as a backup
- see the actually applied System Prompt preset name on the node and in the editor; edited unmatched text is shown as `Custom`
- connect a positive FLOAT to `video seconds` to append a sentence such as `This is an 8-second video.` to each LLM user prompt without changing the saved Prompt text
- use `(Deno) Local LLM Reviewer` as a gate before Save nodes
- pass or block IMAGE and AUDIO outputs from a review text result
- approve the current reviewed result once, or rerun the path before the reviewer

The `Unsloth` provider requires an API key in the `DENO_LOCAL_LLM_UNSLOTH_API_KEY` environment variable. Set it before starting ComfyUI. The key is not stored in a workflow or PNG metadata.

Remote LM Studio note: the dedicated `LM Studio` provider currently uses `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`. To call LM Studio on another PC that you own on the same trusted LAN, enable **Serve on Local Network** on that PC, set an exact allowlist before starting ComfyUI (for example `DENO_LOCAL_LLM_ALLOWED_HOSTS=192.168.1.50:1234`), restart ComfyUI, then select `Custom` and use `http://192.168.1.50:1234/v1` as the Custom Server URL. The allowlist accepts exact private IP-and-port pairs only and is never stored in workflows or PNG metadata. The Custom connector does not currently send an authentication token or use LM Studio-specific unload helpers, so restrict the server port to the ComfyUI PC with the host firewall and manage the remote model from LM Studio.

LM Studio compatibility note: if LM Studio rejects its optional reasoning-control field before any generated output starts, the node retries once without that field. The selected server and model then decide their default reasoning behavior; the Thinking toggle cannot force a reasoning mode that the server does not expose.

Audio note: the Local LLM Loader does not send raw AUDIO into a local model. Its optional `audio_context` STRING input can carry an upstream transcript and acoustic report as data while preserving the user's prompt. The Reviewer can gate AUDIO when another text-generation node, including ComfyUI audio-capable text generation, creates the review text.

## Why This Exists

These nodes are built to reduce repeated setup friction in actual ComfyUI production work.
The goal is not to chase huge feature lists. The goal is to make the workflows people repeat every day feel faster, cleaner, and easier to teach.

## Search Tips

- In ComfyUI Manager or Registry, search for `Deno Custom Nodes`.
- On the canvas, search for `(Deno)` or the node name, such as `Resize Box`.
- Use [Included Nodes](#included-nodes) to find the tool and its requirements.

## Install

For the recommended Manager installation, follow [Quick Start](#quick-start).

<details>
<summary>Manual installation and updates</summary>

For a manual install, clone inside your `custom_nodes` folder and install dependencies with the same Python executable that starts ComfyUI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deno2026/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes.git
cd comfyui-deno-custom-nodes
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For a manual update, run `git pull --ff-only`, reinstall `requirements.txt` with that same Python, and restart ComfyUI. Manager/Registry installs handle the package dependencies automatically.

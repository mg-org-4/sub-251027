> **Relight your images without re-generating them.**

ReLight is a single, self-contained ComfyUI node that adds up to 3 positionable light sources to any image — colored additive light or precise color correction, with presets, directional gradients, rim lighting, and mask-aware 3D occlusion. It's fast and deterministic: pure image processing, no diffusion pass, no models to download.

**Built on the ComfyUI v3 node schema.**

## 🔧 Installation

### Using ComfyUI-Manager (Recommended)

1. Open ComfyUI and navigate to the Manager
2. Search for "ReLight" in the available custom nodes
3. Click Install
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory
cd path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfyui-relight

# Install dependencies
pip install -r comfyui-relight/requirements.txt

# Restart ComfyUI
```

### Dependencies

ReLight needs `numpy`, `Pillow`, and `scipy` (installed automatically from `requirements.txt`; `torch` is provided by ComfyUI itself).

ReLight works best with high-quality foreground masks. We recommend installing:

- **[ComfyUI Essentials](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials)** - Provides enhanced mask generation and background removal tools

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **Add the ReLight 💡 node** to your workflow (found under category "image/lighting")
2. **Connect your source image**
3. **Connect a foreground mask** (white = subject, black = background) — optional, but required for occlusion ("Behind Subject" / "In Front of Subject") and background compositing
4. **Select a preset** like "Rim Light (Behind)" or design your own lighting
5. **Adjust settings** to taste
6. **Preview your results** in real-time

### Sample Workflow

A ready-to-load workflow is included: [example workflow.json](https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfyui-relight/blob/main/example%20workflow.json)

The repository includes a sample workflow file (`example workflow.json`) that demonstrates:

1. Loading an image
2. Removing the background using ComfyUI Essentials' RemBG nodes
3. Applying the ReLight node with "Warm Sunset Glow" preset in "Behind Subject" mode
4. Viewing the results through both standard preview and debug visualization

Simply load this workflow in ComfyUI to see ReLight in action!

## 📸 Examples

### Dramatic Three-Point RGB Lighting

![Before/After Three-Point RGB Lighting (_in case you really want to overdo things_)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65024b82-2ba2-465e-9505-ca2025b93764)

This example uses three colored lights to create a purposely over the top striking RGB lighting setup:

- **Main Settings**: 
  - 3 light sources
  - "Behind Subject" light direction
  - 2.0 effect strength

- **Light 1 (Red)**: 
  - Position: far right (0.99, 0.15)
  - RGB Color: (255, 0, 0)
  - High intensity (2.0)

- **Light 2 (Green)**:
  - Position: left side (0.2, 0.3)
  - RGB Color: (0, 255, 0)
  - Medium intensity (0.7)

- **Light 3 (Blue)**:
  - Position: bottom center (0.3, 0.8)
  - RGB Color: (0, 0, 255)
  - Low intensity (0.2)

This setup creates vibrant color separation while maintaining the "Behind Subject" mode to emphasize the edges of the figure with dramatic rim lighting.

### Other Lighting Ideas to Try

Here are some additional lighting scenarios that showcase ReLight's versatility:

#### Split Lighting Portrait
![Brighten a subject and make it pop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1d81a70-0c10-460a-bd57-e6c78472a7e9)

Create dramatic portrait lighting with a strong contrast between light and shadow:
- Single light source at position (0.05, 0.5)
- Large outer radius (0.8)
- High contrast (25)
- Reduced saturation (-15)
- "In Front of Subject" light direction

#### Sunset Silhouette
![Spidey outlined by the sun](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed5851a-3607-46c1-a1ba-eb3d297733d4)

Create a beautiful sunset silhouette effect:
- Light positioned low and centered (0.5, 0.9)
- Warm colors (255, 180, 100) (enable "use colored lights")
- "Behind Subject" light direction
- High rim amplification (3.0)
- Moderate mask blur (60)

#### Atmospheric Fog Light
![Creature with foggy lighting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db0d51da-6e9f-4359-9af0-2213954e010e)

Simulate light breaking through fog or mist:
- Light positioned high (0.5, 0.1)
- Cool blue-white color (200, 220, 255) (enable "use colored lights")
- "In Front of Subject" light direction
- High mask blur (100)
- Gradient mode enabled
- Medium intensity (1.5)

#### Moonlight Through Window
![Note hair illumination from moonlight in "After" image on right](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e6e941c-9ea8-437e-bbcc-9fef3747dca4)

Simulate soft moonlight streaming through a window:
- Light positioned at upper corner (0.8, 0.2)
- Cool blue color (120, 150, 255) (enable "use colored lights")
- Gradient mode enabled
- Low brightness (-10)
- High blue cast (Temperature -30)


## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Layer Multiple Lights** - Use several ReLight nodes in sequence for complex lighting setups
- **Debug View** - Enable `show_debug_info` to visualize light positions and better understand the effect
- **Mask Quality Matters** - The better your foreground mask, the more realistic your lighting effects
- **Combine with ControlNet** - Use ReLight results as input for ControlNet for guided image generation
- **Perfect Rim Lighting** - For the best rim effects:
  1. Position light behind subject
  2. Use "Behind Subject" light direction
  3. Increase rim_amplification for stronger edges
  4. Keep mask_blur values low (20-40) for crisp edges

*For full parameter list, please refer to the detailed section below.*

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No visible effect | Increase effect_strength or light_intensity |
| Light too strong | Decrease effect_strength or specific intensity/brightness values |
| Occlusion not working | Ensure apply_3d_lighting is True and mask is connected |
| Black debug image | Check ComfyUI console for errors |
| Node fails to load | Ensure scipy is installed |
| Poor mask quality | Use RemBG from ComfyUI Essentials for better masks |
| Preset not working as expected | Try toggling use_colored_lights or apply_3d_lighting |
| Subject looks unlit / effect appears reversed | Your mask may be inverted — ReLight expects white=subject, black=background (invert it upstream with an InvertMask node) |
| Debug image not showing correctly | Enable show_debug_info and check console logs |

### 🔄 Updates

- **v2.1.0** - Correctness & polish
  - **Fixed: outer-area color correction now actually applies.** The `outer_*` (brightness/contrast/saturation/temperature/tint/gamma) parameters were previously never used — standard-mode lighting now applies inner settings inside the inner radius and outer settings in the surrounding ring, as documented (this is what presets like "Soft Window Light" and "Spotlight" were designed around)
  - Colored lights in standard mode now have true radial falloff (full strength inside the inner radius, fading to zero at the outer radius) — `inner_circle_radius` previously had no effect
  - `mask` input is now optional (matching actual behavior); without a mask the node applies plain lighting and disables occlusion/compositing
  - Removed silent mask auto-inversion heuristic that could corrupt masks of large subjects; a console warning is logged instead if a mask looks inverted
  - Fixed v3 schema output ids (schema now passes ComfyUI validation)
  - Console spam removed — verbose diagnostics moved to debug-level logging
  - Packaging: removed `torch` from requirements (ComfyUI provides it)

- **v2.0.0** - ComfyUI v3 Migration
  - Fully migrated to ComfyUI v3 schema
  - Updated to use new io.ComfyNode base class
  - Converted INPUT_TYPES to define_schema with proper type objects
  - All methods converted to classmethods for v3 compatibility
  - Updated outputs to use proper display_name labels
  - Modernized extension registration with ComfyExtension and comfy_entrypoint

- **v1.0** - Initial Release
  - Added support for multiple light sources
  - Implemented rim lighting and 3D lighting simulation
  - Included 8 professional lighting presets
  - Added debug visualization
  - Improved mask handling and compatibility with ComfyUI Essentials

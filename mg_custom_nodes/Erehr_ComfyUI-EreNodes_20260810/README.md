## 🧭 Compatibility

- **ComfyUI**: registered via standard `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` (works on current and older installs). Node IDs are stable — workflows remain interchangeable.
- **Subgraphs**: supported. The prefix separator is passed as a real input instead of being read from workflow metadata.
- **Nodes 2.0 (Vue renderer)**: supported. Tag UI is DOM widgets in both the classic LiteGraph renderer and Nodes 2.0 (same implementation). The old canvas-drawn UI was removed; it remains available in git history.

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Via ComfyUI Manager:**
1. Open ComfyUI Manager in your ComfyUI interface
2. Search for "EreNodes" 
3. Click Install
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory
cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/erehr/ComfyUI-EreNodes.git

# Restart ComfyUI
```

> **Tip**: After installation, you'll find the new nodes under the "EreNodes" category in your ComfyUI node browser.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Setup

1. **Custom Autocomplete**: Place your custom CSV tag files in the `__autocomplete__` folder within the EreNodes directory or choose existing one from Settings
2. **Preview Images**: Add preview images to enhance your tag browsing experience
3. **Create Your First Tag Group**: Use any EreNodes prompt node to save your favorite tag combinations

### 🎮 Basic Usage

**Using Autocomplete:**
- Start typing in any EreNodes text or add tag field
- Use Tab or arrow keys to navigate suggestions
- Press Enter to select
- Enjoy intelligent tag completion with aliases

**Managing Tag Groups:**
- Click on any tag nodes ≡ menu button to "Save as Tag Group". Select (or create) folder, type filename and select optional image. 
- Access saved groups through the ≡ 'Load Tag Group' (loading content of tag group) or + button 'Add tag' (loading tag group as single combined pill)
- Import/export tag groups for sharing with the community

**LoRA Loading:**

EreNodes provides flexible LoRA loading options to fit different workflow preferences:

| Method | Description | Compatible Nodes | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **LoRA Stack** | Use "Prompt to LoRA Stack" node to extract `<lora:name:strength>` tags and connect to stack-compatible nodes | • [Efficiency Nodes](https://github.com/jags111/efficiency-nodes-comfyui)<br>• [ComfyRoll Custom Nodes](https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes)<br>• [LoRA Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager) | Best for mixing multiple sources of LoRAs |
| **Direct Loading** | Use nodes that load LoRAs directly from prompt text in place of standard LoRA loaders. | • [LoRA Tag Loader](https://github.com/badjeff/comfyui_lora_tag_loader)<br>• [Impact Wildcard Encode](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)<br>• [PCLazyLoRALoader](https://github.com/asagi4/comfyui-prompt-control) | Best for simple workflows or when using wildcards |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Search Efficiently**: Use partial matches or space for multi word phrases
- **Visual Organization**: Set preview images for your most-used ta groups
- **Quick Edits**: Right-click any tag for instant editing options
- **Experiment**: Use the Randomizer node to discover new prompt combinations
- **Convertible**: All tag nodes can be converted to another under ≡ menu
- **Customize output**: Separators between nodes and individual tags can be set customized in node Properties

## 📋 Changelog

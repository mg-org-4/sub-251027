# Deep tag search index: a SQLite cache of the tags inside every group, built once, kept current incrementally and queried in milliseconds.
# It lives at `<tag groups root>/.erenodes_tag_index.db`, so it follows the `tag_groups.location` setting and the leading dot keeps it out of every listing route.
# `groups(id, path, mtime, size)` is the freshness stamp; tag strings are interned once in `names(id, tag)`, and `tags(tid, gid)` is WITHOUT ROWID with PRIMARY KEY(tid, gid), so a prefix range over `names` resolves to index-only scans of integers.

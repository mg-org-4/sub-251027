"""
HunyuanImage-3.0 Block Swap Manager - V2 Unified Node Support

Kijai-style explicit block swapping for transformer blocks.
Moves blocks between GPU and CPU during forward pass to enable
large generations on limited VRAM.

Uses pre-allocated pinned CPU buffers to eliminate CRT heap fragmentation
on Windows. Without this, each block.to('cpu') allocates ~2GB via
_aligned_malloc which the CRT never returns to the OS, causing RSS to
grow monotonically across generations.

    Manages transformer block swapping between GPU and CPU.
    
    This implements Kijai-style explicit block swapping where:
    1. Some blocks stay on GPU (always resident)
    2. Other blocks are swapped in/out during forward pass
    3. Prefetching loads next block while current one runs
    
    Memory Management:
        Pre-allocates pinned CPU buffers for all swappable blocks during
        setup_initial_placement(). All subsequent GPU<->CPU transfers reuse
        these buffers - zero new CPU allocations per generation. This prevents
        Windows CRT heap fragmentation that causes RSS to grow unboundedly.
        Pinned memory also enables faster async DMA for prefetch transfers.

        Fix bitsandbytes Linear8bitLt weight and state device after block.to().
        
        bitsandbytes has a bug where block.to(device) does NOT move weight.CB,
        weight.SCB, state.CB, or state.SCB to the target device. This is because:
        
        1. Module._apply(fn) calls fn(param) -> Int8Params.to() which creates a NEW
           Int8Params with CB/SCB on the target device, but Module._apply only copies
           param.data (the raw tensor), discarding the new CB/SCB attributes.
        2. Linear8bitLt.to() overrides .to() to handle state.CB/SCB, but this override
           is never called when a PARENT module calls .to() (Module._apply recurses
           via child._apply, not child.to()).
        
        The INT8 lifecycle:
        - Before first forward: weight.CB has the compressed buffer, state.CB is None
        - After first forward: init_8bit_state() moves weight.CB -> state.CB, weight.CB = None
        - After matmul: weight.data is set to state.CB (they share the same tensor)
        
        CRITICAL ALIASING INVARIANT:
        After init_8bit_state(), weight.data and state.CB point to the SAME tensor.
        We must maintain this alias during device transfers. If we create separate
        tensors via state.CB.to(device), each block's memory is DOUBLED — both on
        GPU (causing OOM) and in pinned CPU RAM (causing massive RSS bloat).
        Fix: always set state.CB = weight.data after moving weight.data.
        
        This method explicitly moves ALL int8 data to the target device.

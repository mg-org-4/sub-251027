# ComfyUI Prompt Manager
## A comprehensive prompt toolkit for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) — Save, Generate, and Extract prompts with full LoRA support.

A complete prompt management solution featuring three core capabilities:

**Prompt Manager** — Save and organize prompts with categories, simple UI with minimal feature.

**Prompt Manager Advanced** — Save and organize prompts with categories, complete with matching LoRA stacks, trigger words, and thumbnail previews. Supports dual LoRA stacks for complex workflows like Wan videos. Toggle LoRAs on/off or adjust strengths directly from saved presets. Will also remap Loras if path differs.

**Prompt Generator** — Generate and enhance prompts using local LLMs via [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Supports text enhancement, image analysis with vision models (Qwen3VL), and thinking mode for deeper reasoning. Analyze up to 5 images at once.

**Prompt Extractor** — Extract prompts and LoRA configurations from existing images, videos, or JSON workflow files. Will extract first frame from any video. Automatically parses embedded metadata and outputs active LoRA as Lora stacks. When used in conjunction with Prompt Manager Advanced, Loras will be automatically found if available, regardless of path. For those that aren't, right click offers the option to look for them on Civitai.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
- Python 3.8+
- requests >= 2.31.0
- huggingface_hub >= 0.20.0
- psutil >= 5.9.0
- tqdm >= 4.66.0
- Pillow >= 10.0.0
- colorama
- llama-server (from llama.cpp)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Prompts don't appear in the dropdown
- **Solution**: Make sure the category has saved prompts. Try creating a new prompt first.

**Problem**: Changes aren't saved
- **Solution**: Click the "Save Prompt" button after making changes. Direct edits in the text field are temporary.

**Problem**: Can't see LLM output in the node
- **Solution**: Make sure the LLM output is connected to the "llm_input" and run the workflow.

**Problem**: "llama-server command not found"
- **Solution**: Install llama.cpp and make sure `llama-server` is available in command line. See [llama.cpp releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases)

**Problem**: "No models found"
- **Solution**: Either place a .gguf file in the `models/` folder, or connect the Prompt Generator Option node and select a model size (1.7B, 4B, or 8B) to download from HuggingFace

**Problem**: Server won't start
- **Solution**: Check that port 8080 is not in use. Close any existing llama-server processes.

**Problem**: Model download fails
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and HuggingFace availability. Large models may take time to download.

**Problem**: Generation is slow
- **Solution**: Either, Use a smaller quantized model (Q4 instead of Q8) or toggle 'stop_server_after' to quit llama.cpp after generating prompt.

**Problem**: Default Model used is not what I want
- **Solution**: You can set your preferred model in the ComfyUI settings. Simply add its full name, with .gguf extension, for both the VL and base models. Enabling Thinking in the Generator might change what is used for VL models.

# ComfyUI Prompt Manager
## A comprehensive prompt toolkit for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) — Save, Generate, and Extract prompts with full LoRA support.

A complete prompt management solution featuring three core capabilities:

**Prompt Manager** — Save and organize prompts with categories, simple UI with minimal feature.

**Prompt Manager Advanced** — Save and organize prompts with categories, complete with matching LoRA stacks, trigger words, and thumbnail previews. Supports dual LoRA stacks for complex workflows like Wan videos. Toggle LoRAs on/off or adjust strengths directly from saved presets. Will also remap Loras if path differs.

**Prompt Generator** — Generate and enhance prompts using local LLMs via [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Supports text enhancement, image analysis with vision models (Qwen3.5), and thinking mode for deeper reasoning. Analyze up to 5 images at once.

**Prompt Extractor** — Extract prompts and LoRA configurations from existing images, videos, or JSON workflow files. Will extract first frame from any video. Automatically parses embedded metadata and outputs active LoRA as Lora stacks. When used in conjunction with Prompt Manager Advanced, Loras will be automatically found if available, regardless of path. For those that aren't, right click offers the option to look for them on Civitai. Browse files from both your input and output folders.

**Better Image Loader** — A streamlined image and video loader with the same powerful file browser as Prompt Extractor, but focused purely on loading media. Browse input or output folders, preview images and videos, scrub through video frames, and drag-and-drop files — without any metadata extraction or LoRA processing.

- **JSON Output**: Optional structured JSON output with scene breakdown
- **Thinking Support**: Support Thinking models to perform deeper generative reasoning.
- **Automatic Server Management**: Starts/stops llama.cpp server as needed, with automatic shut off at exit.
- **Smart Model Selection**: Auto-selects appropriate model based on mode, using mmproj-based vision detection.

### Prompt Generator Options
- **Model Selection**: Choose from local models or download Qwen3.5 models from HuggingFace

### Switch Any
- **Universal Input Switch**: Select one of up to 10 inputs of any type — models, LoRAs, strings, images, anything
- **True Lazy Switching**: Non-selected inputs are completely invisible to ComfyUI — upstream nodes are never validated or executed, so unused models won't be loaded
- **Named Inputs**: Provide custom names via a single string field using comma or semicolon separators (e.g., `WAN; FLUX; SDXL`)
- **Adjustable Input Count**: Slider to set 1–10 active inputs — unused slots are hidden from the node
- **Named Dropdown**: The select dropdown displays your custom names instead of generic numbers

### Save Video H264/H265
- **Codec Selection**: Choose between H.264 (8-bit, better compatibility) or H.265/HEVC (10-bit, better compression and gradients)
- **Chroma Subsampling**: Select yuv420 (most compatible), yuv422 (better for video editing), or yuv444 (best color, no chroma loss)
- **Quality Control**: Constant Rate Factor (CRF) from 0-51 for fine-tuned quality vs file size balance
- **Preview Mode**: Quick preview encoding to temp folder without saving to output
- **Save Latent**: Optionally save the latent alongside the video for later experimentation without regeneration
- **Audio Support**: Preserves audio from VIDEO input with proper sync
- **Workflow Metadata**: Embeds full workflow metadata in MP4 (unlike VideoHelperSuite which strips it from audio clips)
- **Browser Preview**: Automatically generates browser-compatible preview for H.265 + yuv422/444 combinations

### Animated Latent Preview
- **Video Sampling Preview**: Display animated previews during KSampler execution for video models
- **TAESD Support**: Works with both Latent2RGB and TAESD preview methods (including high-quality video TAESD)
- **Auto Frame Rate**: Automatically detects optimal playback rate based on video model (Wan, Mochi, LTXV, HunyuanVideo, etc.)
- **Manual Rate Override**: Optional playback rate override in preferences
- **VHS Compatible**: Automatically defers to VideoHelperSuite if installed to avoid conflicts

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
- Python 3.8+
- requests
- huggingface_hub
- psutil
- tqdm
- Pillow
- colorama
- llama-server (from llama.cpp)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Prompts don't appear in the dropdown
- **Solution**: Make sure the category has saved prompts. Try creating a new prompt first.

**Problem**: Changes aren't saved
- **Solution**: Click the "Save Prompt" button after making changes. Direct edits in the text field are temporary.

**Problem**: Can't see LLM output in the node
- **Solution**: Make sure the LLM output is connected to the "llm_input" and run the workflow.

**Problem**: "llama-server command not found"
- **Solution**: Install llama.cpp and make sure `llama-server` is available in command line. See [llama.cpp releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases)

**Problem**: "No models found"
- **Solution**: Either place a .gguf file in the `models/` folder, or connect the Prompt Generator Option node and select a model size (1.7B, 4B, or 8B) to download from HuggingFace

**Problem**: Server won't start
- **Solution**: Check that port 8080 is not in use. Close any existing llama-server processes.

**Problem**: Model download fails
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and HuggingFace availability. Large models may take time to download.

**Problem**: Generation is slow
- **Solution**: Either, Use a smaller quantized model (Q4 instead of Q8) or toggle 'stop_server_after' to quit llama.cpp after generating prompt.

**Problem**: Default Model used is not what I want
- **Solution**: You can set your preferred model in the ComfyUI settings. Simply add its full name, with .gguf extension, for both the VL and base models. Enabling Thinking in the Generator might change what is used for VL models.

# ComfyUI Prompt Manager
## A comprehensive prompt and workflow toolkit for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) — Save, Generate, Extract, Build, and Reuse workflows with full LoRA support.

A complete prompt and workflow management suite featuring:

## v2.0 Introduces: Workflow Extractor + Workflow Builder + Workflow Renderer + Workflow Manager

The goal of this v2.0 workflow layer is to strip workflows down to their core elements so they are easier to understand, edit, and reuse.

- Extract metadata from source images and videos (ComfyUI or A1111/Forge)
- Reduce complex graphs into a clean, editable workflow core
- Rebuild and run from that simplified core with Workflow Builder to Workflow Renderer
- Save and reuse clean workflow entries through Workflow Manager
- Combine with Prompt tools (Prompt Manager, and Prompt Generator) for easier prompt creation and generation.

Think of it as workflow de-spaghetti: keep the important parts, remove unnecessary complexity.

This release marks version 2.0.0. More polish and quality-of-life improvements are planned.

**Prompt Manager** — Save and organize prompts with categories, complete with matching LoRA stacks, trigger words, and thumbnail previews. Supports dual LoRA stacks for complex workflows like Wan videos. Toggle LoRAs on/off or adjust strengths directly from saved presets. Supports workflow_data input from Workflow Builder or Prompt Extractor to pull workflow prompts and LoRA stacks directly into PMA. Will also remap LoRAs if paths differ.

**Prompt Generator** — Generate and enhance prompts using local LLMs via [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Supports text enhancement, image analysis with vision models (Qwen3.5), and thinking mode for deeper reasoning. Analyze up to 5 images at once.

**Prompt Extractor** — Extract prompts, LoRA configurations, and checkpoint/model paths from existing images, videos, or JSON workflow files. Extracts the first frame from any video. Automatically parses embedded metadata and outputs active LoRAs as LoRA stacks, plus resolved model paths (High/Low for dual-model workflows like Wan). Supports ComfyUI, A1111/Forge, and WebP metadata formats. When used with Prompt Manager Advanced, LoRAs are automatically found if available, regardless of path. For those that are not, right-click offers the option to look for them on Civitai. Browse files from both your input and output folders.

**Prompt Model Loader** — Load checkpoints, diffusion, or GGUF models from a string path output by Prompt Extractor. Auto-detects whether the model is a checkpoint (outputs MODEL + CLIP + VAE) or a diffusion/UNET/GGUF model (outputs MODEL only). Displays model type badge and name directly on the node. Works around ComfyUI's combo type limitation, allowing extracted model paths to connect directly to a loader. Supports [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) models when the extension is installed.

**Workflow Suite of Tools** — Build and re-render extracted workflows with dedicated nodes:

- **Workflow Extractor**: Reads workflow metadata and normalizes it into reusable workflow_data.
- **Workflow Builder**: Lets you edit and assemble a clean core workflow from extracted metadata.
- **Workflow Renderer**: Runs built-in workflow templates for near one-click generation after Builder setup.
- **Workflow Bridge**: Passes workflow context and routing data between nodes cleanly.
- **Workflow Model Loader**: Resolves and loads the right model/checkpoint from workflow data.
- **Workflow Manager**: Saves and reuses cleaned workflow entries for fast reruns.

Builder + Renderer + Workflow Manager provides a streamlined generation path: configure Builder once, connect Renderer and Save Image/Save Video, and save both the output and the resulting workflow.

Built-in workflow support includes Flux 1, Flux 2, Ernie, SDXL, Wan, Qwen, Z-Image, Wan Image, and Wan Video (I2V and T2V).

**Workflow Builder + Workflow Manager Reuse Loop** — Build workflow_data from extracted image/video metadata or from Workflow Builder directly, then save and reuse those workflow entries through Workflow Manager.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
- Python 3.8+
- requests
- huggingface_hub
- psutil
- tqdm
- Pillow
- colorama
- llama-server (from llama.cpp)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Prompts don't appear in the dropdown
- **Solution**: Make sure the category has saved prompts. Try creating a new prompt first.

**Problem**: Changes aren't saved
- **Solution**: Click the "Save Prompt" button after making changes. Direct edits in the text field are temporary.

**Problem**: Can't see LLM output in the node
- **Solution**: Make sure the LLM output is connected to the "llm_input" and run the workflow.

**Problem**: "llama-server command not found"
- **Solution**: Install llama.cpp and make sure `llama-server` is available in command line. See [llama.cpp releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases)

**Problem**: "No models found"
- **Solution**: Either place a .gguf file in the `models/` folder, or connect the Prompt Generator Options node and select a model size (1.7B, 4B, or 8B) to download from HuggingFace

**Problem**: Server won't start
- **Solution**: Check that port 8080 is not in use. Close any existing llama-server processes.

**Problem**: Model download fails
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and HuggingFace availability. Large models may take time to download.

**Problem**: Generation is slow
- **Solution**: Use a smaller quantized model (Q4 instead of Q8), or toggle 'stop_server_after' to quit llama.cpp after generating a prompt.

**Problem**: Default model used is not what I want
- **Solution**: You can set your preferred model in the ComfyUI settings. Simply add its full name, with .gguf extension, for both the VL and base models. Enabling Thinking in the Generator might change what is used for VL models.

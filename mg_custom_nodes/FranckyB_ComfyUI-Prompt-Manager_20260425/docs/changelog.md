# Changelog

## version 2.2.0
- **Recipe_data v2 expansion and slot-aware workflows**
  - Expanded v2 compatibility across Builder, Relay, Renderer, Manager, and extraction utilities.
  - Improved model slot behavior for `model_a`/`model_b`/`model_c`/`model_d`, including WAN pair handling.
- **Recipe Builder Update flow and persistence improvements**
  - Update Recipe now respects Pull From selection consistently and supports expected clear behavior for empty/none selections.
  - Pull From / Send To state persistence improved across tab switches and workflow reloads.
  - Update Recipe visibility refined to avoid incomplete Builder-to-Builder pull paths.
- **LoRA synchronization and execution-order fixes**
  - Fixed connected LoRA add/remove timing so `recipe_data` reflects changes on first execute.
  - Improved LoRA state authority between connected inputs and persisted UI overrides.
- **Renderer validation hardening**
  - Renderer now fails fast with a clear error when the selected model slot is undefined.
  - Prevents silent renders from empty/non-existent selected model slots.
- **Prompt Generator GPU utilization and VRAM prep**
  - Ensured llama.cpp server launch uses `-ngl 100` so generation is pushed to GPU as much as possible.
  - Added more aggressive cache/VRAM flushing before generation to reduce memory pressure and improve run reliability.

# Changelog

## version 2.5.0
- **Recipe Builder is now Multi-model Only**
  - Expanded Builder authoring around `recipe_data` with slot-aware model blocks (`model_a`/`model_b`/`model_c`/`model_d`).
  - Improved cross-slot behavior for prompts, LoRAs, sampler settings, and resolution handling in multi-model workflows.
- **Authoritative Builder extraction flow**
  - Extraction now preserves Builder-authored v2 model data as the source of truth when embedded Builder v2 metadata is present.
  - Added compatibility safeguards so legacy/non-v2 workflows continue to use fallback extraction logic.
- **Builder lock/reset and execution consistency**
  - Improved update and execute behavior so incoming recipe values, lock states, and current UI values resolve more predictably.
  - Strength/reset handling was tightened for better consistency across slot updates and reruns.
- **New LoRA utility node: MultiLoraCombine**
  - Added `MultiLoraCombine` to merge optional multi-stack input with optional stack A/B/C/D inputs into a single `MULTI_LORA_STACK` output.
  - Helps consolidate mixed LoRA sources for multi-model Builder and downstream recipe flows.
- **New feature: Multi LoRA Stacker with Lora-Manager compatibility**
  - Added a new Multi LoRA Stacker for slot-aware and multi-stack recipe flows.
  - Compatible with [Lora-Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager), including interoperability with managed LoRA selections and previews.

## version 2.2.0
- **Recipe_data v2 expansion and slot-aware workflows**
  - Expanded v2 compatibility across Builder, Relay, Renderer, Manager, and extraction utilities.
  - Improved model slot behavior for `model_a`/`model_b`/`model_c`/`model_d`, including WAN pair handling.
- **Recipe Builder Update flow and persistence improvements**
  - Update Recipe now respects Pull From selection consistently and supports expected clear behavior for empty/none selections.
  - Pull From / Send To state persistence improved across tab switches and workflow reloads.
  - Update Recipe visibility refined to avoid incomplete Builder-to-Builder pull paths.
- **LoRA synchronization and execution-order fixes**
  - Fixed connected LoRA add/remove timing so `recipe_data` reflects changes on first execute.
  - Improved LoRA state authority between connected inputs and persisted UI overrides.
- **Renderer validation hardening**
  - Renderer now fails fast with a clear error when the selected model slot is undefined.
  - Prevents silent renders from empty/non-existent selected model slots.
- **Prompt Generator GPU utilization and VRAM prep**
  - Ensured llama.cpp server launch uses `-ngl 100` so generation is pushed to GPU as much as possible.
  - Added more aggressive cache/VRAM flushing before generation to reduce memory pressure and improve run reliability.

## Workflow

The extension now includes the `MatAnyone2Video` node, which runs the improved MatAnyoneV2 model for higher-quality and more robust video matting.

**Workflow**: [workflow/workflow_mat_anyone.json](workflow/workflow_mat_anyone.json)

(Not a workflow-embedded image)

Inputs:

- src_video
- `forground_mask` (`IMAGE`) or `foreground_MASK` (`MASK`): The input mask. IMAGE option will automatically convert a black/white image to a mask. At least one option must be given.
- `solid_color` (optional): The solid color to create a screen. Defaults to Green Screen.
- `mask_frame`: The input mask's index (defaults to 0). Support first (0), last and middle frame.
- `n_warmup`: Number of iterations to warm up the model. Defaults to 10.

**Memory Management Inputs**:

- `max_internal_size` (optional): Resizes the internal processing resolution to save memory (e.g., 360, 480). Default is -1 (full resolution).
- `max_mem_frames` (optional): The number of key frames kept in high-resolution working memory. Default is 5.
- `use_long_term` (optional): Limits active memory scaling by compressing older frames into long-term prototype memories, preventing OOM over time. Default is False. (Useful for long videos)

Your input mask won't actually be in the final matte. Instead, the warmup process generate a new input mask, which is then propagated throughout the video.

Additional Inputs for V2:

- `r_erode` (optional): The radius for morphological erosion applied to the `foreground_mask` before processing (defaults to 0). Useful for refining rough masks.
- `r_dilate` (optional): The radius for morphological dilation applied to the `foreground_mask` before processing (defaults to 0).

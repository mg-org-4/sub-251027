"""
Utility helpers for walking graph-like metadata payloads.

Some exporters wrap the actual workflow/prompt dictionaries inside nested structures
such as groups, subgraphs, or wrapper objects. These helpers recursively visit every
dictionary in the payload so that downstream extractors can spot the real data no matter
how deeply it is tucked in.

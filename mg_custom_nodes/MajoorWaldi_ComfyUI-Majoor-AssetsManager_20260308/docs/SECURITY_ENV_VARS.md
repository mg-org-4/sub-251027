# Majoor Assets Manager - Security Model & Environment Variables Guide

**Version**: 2.3.3  
**Last Updated**: February 28, 2026

## Overview
The Majoor Assets Manager implements a comprehensive security model to protect your system while providing powerful asset management capabilities. This guide covers the security architecture, threat models, and security-related environment variables.

**New in v2.3.3**: Enhanced API token support, improved Safe Mode controls, and better remote access configuration.

## Security Architecture

### Defense Layers
The Assets Manager employs multiple layers of security:

#### Application Layer Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Path containment and validation
- File type verification
- Access control mechanisms

#### Network Layer Security
- CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- Origin validation for sensitive requests
- Rate limiting on expensive operations
- Secure communication protocols

#### File System Security
- Root containment validation
- Path traversal prevention
- Permission checking
- Symlink handling controls

### Trust Model
- **User Input**: All user input is validated and sanitized
- **File System**: Only allowed directories are accessible
- **External Tools**: Tools run with limited privileges
- **Network**: Requests validated against origin policies

## Authentication & Authorization

### Write access guard (recommended)
ComfyUI is often used locally, but it can be exposed via `--listen`, reverse proxies, or tunnels.
To reduce risk, Majoor blocks destructive/write operations from non-local clients by default.

- **Default behavior (no token configured)**: allow write operations only from loopback clients (`127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost`).
- **Token behavior**: if `MAJOOR_API_TOKEN` (or `MJR_API_TOKEN`) is set, all write operations require it.
  - Send the token via `X-MJR-Token: <token>` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

#### Overrides (use with care)
- `MAJOOR_REQUIRE_AUTH=1` forces token auth even for loopback (requires `MAJOOR_API_TOKEN`).
- `MAJOOR_ALLOW_REMOTE_WRITE=1` allows remote write operations without a token (**unsafe**).
- `MAJOOR_ALLOW_BOOTSTRAP=1` temporarily enables initial `/bootstrap-token` provisioning. Disable it after first successful bootstrap.

### Client-side token handling
Set the same secret inside ComfyUI's Settings modal at **Security -> Majoor: API Token**. Runtime tokens are kept in `sessionStorage` (tab/session scoped) and bootstrap/rotate responses set an `httpOnly` cookie (`mjr_write_token`) so JavaScript does not need to read plaintext secrets from API responses.

### Safe Mode (default enabled)
Safe Mode adds an explicit opt-in layer for operations that modify files or user metadata.

- `MAJOOR_SAFE_MODE` (default: enabled)  
  - Set `MAJOOR_SAFE_MODE=0` to disable Safe Mode.
- `MAJOOR_ALLOW_WRITE=1`  
  - Allows rating/tags writes while Safe Mode is enabled.
- `MAJOOR_ALLOW_DELETE=1`  
  - Enables asset deletion (disabled by default).
- `MAJOOR_ALLOW_RENAME=1`  
  - Enables asset rename (disabled by default).
- `MAJOOR_ALLOW_OPEN_IN_FOLDER=1`  
  - Enables `/mjr/am/open-in-folder` (disabled by default).

### Access Control
- File access limited to ComfyUI's allowed directories
- No direct access to system files outside allowed paths
- Permission inheritance from ComfyUI's file system access
- No elevation of privileges possible

## CSRF Protection

### Request Validation
All state-changing endpoints require additional validation:

#### XMLHttpRequest Header
- Requests must include `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`
- Prevents simple form submissions from external sites
- Standard technique for AJAX endpoint protection

#### CSRF Token Alternative
- Alternative validation using `X-CSRF-Token` header
- Provides fallback for different client implementations
- Tokens validated against session state

### Origin Validation
- When `Origin` header is present, it's validated against `Host`
- Prevents cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains
- Protects against certain types of cross-site attacks

## Rate Limiting

### Per-Client Limits
Rate limiting is implemented on expensive endpoints:

#### Affected Endpoints
- Search operations (`/mjr/am/search`)
- Index scanning (`/mjr/am/scan`)
- Metadata extraction (`/mjr/am/metadata`)
- Batch ZIP operations (`/mjr/am/batch-zip`)

#### Limit Configuration
- Implemented in-memory per-client
- Client identity based on IP address
- Configurable thresholds for different operations
- Resets after specified time intervals

#### Trusted Proxy Support
- `X-Forwarded-For` header honored only from trusted proxies
- Controlled by `MAJOOR_TRUSTED_PROXIES` environment variable
- Prevents IP spoofing in proxy environments

## Path Safety & Containment

### Root Validation
All file operations validate root containment:

#### Allowed Roots
- ComfyUI output directory
- ComfyUI input directory  
- Custom roots defined by user
- Collections directory

#### Path Validation Process
1. Normalize the requested path
2. Resolve to absolute path
3. Verify path starts with allowed root
4. Reject if outside allowed boundaries

### Symlink Handling
- Symlinks are handled carefully to prevent directory traversal
- Optional symlink support via `MJR_ALLOW_SYMLINKS` environment variable
- Disabled by default for security
- When enabled, still validates final resolved path

### Path Traversal Prevention
- Input paths are normalized to prevent `../` attacks
- Absolute path resolution ensures final location is verified
- Multiple validation layers prevent bypass attempts

## File Operation Security

### Safe File Operations
- All file operations go through security validation
- Read operations limited to allowed directories
- Write operations limited to index and temporary directories
- Delete operations require additional confirmation

### Batch ZIP Security
- ZIP building streams directly from file handles
- Prevents TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions
- No temporary file copies created during ZIP building
- Automatic cleanup of temporary ZIP files

### File Type Validation
- File types validated before processing
- Dangerous file types blocked from certain operations
- MIME type checking where possible
- Extension validation for security-sensitive operations

## Network Security

### HTTP Security Headers
Applied to Majoor API endpoints only:

#### Content Security Policy
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`
- Prevents execution of injected content
- Applies only to API responses

#### Content Type Options
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- Prevents MIME-type confusion attacks
- Ensures content is treated as declared type

#### Frame Options
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- Prevents embedding in iframes
- Protects against clickjacking

#### Referrer Policy
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- Limits referrer information leakage
- Balances privacy with functionality

### API Versioning Security
- Versioned routes redirect to canonical endpoints
- `/mjr/am/v1/...` redirects to `/mjr/am/...` using 308
- Maintains security headers across versions
- Preserves method and query parameters

## External Tool Security

### Tool Execution Safety
- External tools (ExifTool, FFprobe) run with limited privileges
- Input validation before passing to external tools
- Timeout enforcement to prevent hanging operations
- Output validation after tool execution

### Path Validation for Tools
- File paths validated before passing to external tools
- No direct shell execution, only tool invocation
- Input sanitization for all tool parameters
- Tool output parsing with validation

### Tool Location Security
- Tools can be specified via environment variables
- Default to system PATH for security
- No arbitrary tool execution possible
- Tool paths validated at startup

## Environment Variable Security

### Secure Configuration
Environment variables provide secure configuration without code changes:

#### Configuration Validation
- Environment variables validated at startup
- Invalid values fall back to defaults safely
- No unsafe defaults used
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations

### Sensitive Information Handling
- No passwords or secrets stored in environment
- File paths validated for security
- No direct system command execution via environment
- Configuration changes logged appropriately

### Trusted Proxy Configuration
- `MAJOOR_TRUSTED_PROXIES` controls proxy trust
- Default: `127.0.0.1,::1` (localhost only)
- Prevents IP spoofing in proxy environments
- Critical for rate limiting effectiveness

## Threat Model

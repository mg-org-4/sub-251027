# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-04-10

### 🎉 New Features — Floating Viewer
- **Multi-Pin References (A/B/C/D)**: Pin up to 4 images simultaneously with toggle buttons; pinned slots hold their content while unpinned slots follow Live Stream
- **Node Parameters Sidebar**: View and edit workflow node widgets (prompts, seeds, samplers) directly inside the Floating Viewer
- **Run Button in Viewer**: Queue prompt from the viewer toolbar without switching back to the canvas
- **Expandable Text Areas**: Collapse/expand long text inputs with a toggle button
- **Sidebar Position Setting**: Choose right, left, or bottom placement for the Node Parameters sidebar via Settings; applies immediately without reload
- **Toolbar Layout**: Run and Node Parameters buttons placed at far right for ergonomic access
- **Topbar MFV Button**: New Viewer toggle button in the ComfyUI top action bar — open or close the Floating Viewer without opening the sidebar; highlights when the viewer is active

### 🎉 New Features — Custom Nodes
- **Majoor Save Image 💾**: Drop-in replacement for the built-in SaveImage node that persists `generation_time_ms` in PNG text chunks alongside prompt and workflow metadata; supports auto-detection of generation time from the prompt lifecycle
- **Majoor Save Video 🎬**: Save IMAGE batches or VIDEO inputs as MP4 (h264 via PyAV), GIF, or WebP; embeds `generation_time_ms`, prompt, and workflow directly in the MP4 container metadata; optional PNG sidecar for first frame; supports audio muxing and configurable CRF quality
- **Generation Time Extraction**: The metadata extraction pipeline now reads `generation_time_ms` from PNG text chunks and MP4 container format tags, so the value survives index resets and re-indexing

### ✨ Improved
- **MFV Gen Info Overlay Placement**: Keep Gen Info as the original overlay and automatically place it above the inline player controls when the player is visible
- **MFV Simple Player Keyboard Controls**: Support focused playback shortcuts with Space for play/pause and Left/Right for frame-by-frame stepping

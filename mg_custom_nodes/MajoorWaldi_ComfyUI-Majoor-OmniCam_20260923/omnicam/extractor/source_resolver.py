"""Resolve browser-provided video references for Extractor inspection routes.

TRACK and Scene Reconstruct execution are queue-only. This module survives for
browser-side source metadata and preview-frame requests, where the client sends
a *reference* rather than an executed graph value. That makes it a trust
boundary: a real file is returned only when it sits inside a directory ComfyUI
already owns.

Everything else is refused -- absolute paths, traversal, network shares, URLs,
and anything whose extension or container does not read as video.

``folder_paths`` is imported lazily so the extractor package stays importable,
and unit-testable, without a running ComfyUI.

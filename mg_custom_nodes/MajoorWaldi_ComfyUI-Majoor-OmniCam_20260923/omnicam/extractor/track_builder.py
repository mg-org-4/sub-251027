"""Turn normalized poses into a canonical ``MAJOOR_OMNICAM_TRACK``.

This is where the extractor stops speaking its own vocabulary and starts
speaking OmniCam's. It emits schema version 1 -- nothing about a solved camera
needs a new contract -- and it is deliberately conservative about what it
claims: the metadata says the scale is relative and that the confidence number
is solver coverage, because neither can be anything else from a single moving
lens.

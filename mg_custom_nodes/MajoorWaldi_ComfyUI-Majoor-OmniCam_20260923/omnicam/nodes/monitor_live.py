"""The Monitor's live preflight: a preview of what compiling the selected
profile against a Director's *current, unexecuted* state would report --
computed without queuing a prompt.

Deliberately separate from :class:`MajoorOmniCamMonitor`. A live preflight
runs on every keystroke behind a debounce, so it must never publish over the
execution socket (there is no running node to publish as), and a
mid-edit scene that momentarily fails validation is exactly what the panel
exists to report -- not something that should 500 the route.

Only a Director can be answered live: it is the only upstream that keeps its
state in widgets (``state_json``, ``recording_path``) a route can read without
ComfyUI having executed anything. The frontend is responsible for deciding
whether the connected upstream is one before calling this at all; see
``web-src/monitor/refresh.js``.

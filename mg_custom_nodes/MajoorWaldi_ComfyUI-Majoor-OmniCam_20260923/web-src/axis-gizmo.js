// Viewport corner axis gizmo.
//
// Drawn as an SVG overlay rather than a second WebGL pass, for one decisive
// reason: the playblast records the <canvas>, and a proxy playblast must stay a
// neutral motion reference (AGENTS.md §7). A DOM overlay is excluded from the
// capture for free, with no cleanCapture flag to remember and no extra draw
// call in the render loop.
//
// The maths is a straight reuse of the camera basis the projector already uses,
// so the gizmo can never drift from what the viewport shows.

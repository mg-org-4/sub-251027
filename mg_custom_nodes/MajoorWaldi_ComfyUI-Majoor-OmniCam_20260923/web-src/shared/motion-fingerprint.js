// from a fresh one without re-encoding anything.

// Deliberately a subtractive list: only fields that provably never touch a
// recorded pixel -- which camera you happen to be *editing*, gizmo/snap
// preferences, viewport layout -- are named and excluded. A field nobody has
// classified yet defaults to being hashed. That is the safe direction to be
// wrong in: an extra "playblast outdated" warning costs a re-record, a missed
// one costs trusting footage that no longer matches the scene.

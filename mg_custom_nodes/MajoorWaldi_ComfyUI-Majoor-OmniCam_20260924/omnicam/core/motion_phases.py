"""Segment a camera track into the temporal phases a prompt can describe.

MiniMax H3 and LTX both read shot lists far better than a single global
sentence: "[0.0-1.8s] the camera pushes in ... [1.8-3.6s] it arcs right" says
strictly more than "the intended move is dolly in". The phases here are
*derived from the track*, never invented -- each one is a run of frames whose
dominant motion axis is stable, so a track that really is one continuous move
yields exactly one phase and the prompt stays short.

Decomposition is done in the camera's own basis (dolly/truck/crane) plus
pan/tilt/roll/FOV rates, which is why this lives next to ``camera_math``
rather than in an adapter: it is model-neutral description, not payload.

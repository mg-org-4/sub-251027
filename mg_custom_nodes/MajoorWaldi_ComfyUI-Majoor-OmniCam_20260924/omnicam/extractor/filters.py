"""Smoothing and key reduction for a solved camera trajectory.

Two jobs, both deliberately offline:

* a solve is noisy, and the noise is high-frequency jitter a director never
  wants -- but a causal filter would lag the motion, which is worse than the
  jitter, so the smoothing here is centred and symmetric;
* a solve emits one sample per frame, and a 240-key camera is unusable in the
  Director timeline -- so the reducer drops samples an interpolation can
  reproduce inside a tolerance the user controls.

Everything is deterministic: the same poses and the same settings always
produce the same keys, because the fingerprint downstream depends on it.

"""Optional pycolmap (COLMAP) backend: incremental Structure-from-Motion.

pycolmap (https://github.com/colmap/pycolmap, BSD-3-Clause) is COLMAP's
Python binding. It is *optional*, exactly like DPVO: nothing here imports
``pycolmap`` at module scope, and no code path installs it. Unlike DPVO it
ships prebuilt wheels for Windows with no compiled CUDA extension to match
against ComfyUI's own PyTorch build. See the optional extractor backend
installation documentation for setup.

Where this differs from DPVO and OpenCV/SIFT is the algorithm, not just the
implementation: both of those are sequential visual odometry, integrating one
frame at a time. pycolmap runs incremental *Structure-from-Motion* -- it
extracts and matches features globally first, then registers images one by
one against a shared 3D point cloud and re-optimizes the whole trajectory with
bundle adjustment. That tends to help exactly where OpenCV/SIFT's own module
documents its weakness: low-parallax and rotation-only segments, where
essential-matrix VO has nothing to triangulate and pins translation to zero.
It also means a hard cut in the footage can come back as more than one
disconnected reconstruction, which is reported rather than silently bridged.

Pose convention, verified against pycolmap 4.2.0's own API and confirmed
against a real solve in this repository's environment:

* ``Reconstruction.image(id).cam_from_world()`` returns a ``Rigid3d`` that is
  **world-to-camera** (COLMAP's own naming: it maps a world point into camera
  space). ``.inverse()`` gives camera-to-world, which is what OmniCam's
  backend contract requires.
* ``Rigid3d.rotation.quat`` is ``[x, y, z, w]`` -- confirmed directly:
  ``Rotation3d()`` (identity) reports ``quat == [0, 0, 0, 1]``. No reordering
  needed for ``quaternion_xyzw``.
* the basis is COLMAP's usual computer-vision one: +X right, +Y down, +Z
  forward -- the same as DPVO's, so :data:`PycolmapBackend.basis` is
  ``"opencv"`` for the same reason.

The known intrinsics OmniCam already resolved (from ``lens_mode``) are seeded
as a locked PINHOLE camera rather than left for COLMAP to self-calibrate:
self-calibration on a short clip is exactly where it is least reliable, and a
verified solve in this environment produced a physically nonsensical
``fx=3628, fy=23449`` (a camera cannot have different left-right and top-down
focal lengths on square pixels) the one time refinement was left enabled.

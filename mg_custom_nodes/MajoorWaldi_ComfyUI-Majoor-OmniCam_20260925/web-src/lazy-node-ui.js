/**
 * Attach a node's UI from a lazily imported module.
 *
 * ComfyUI calls `nodeCreated` from the end of the ComfyNode constructor and
 * does *not* await it -- a constructor cannot. So an attach that awaits an
 * import() lands after the node has already been configured, and after the
 * user may have deleted it again.
 *
 * Being late is fine on its own: each product rebuilds its state from the
 * node's widgets when it attaches, and by then `configure()` has written the
 * saved values into them. What is *not* fine is attaching to a node that no
 * longer exists, so that is what this guards.
 *
 * An earlier version also recorded onConfigure / onAfterGraphConfigured while
 * the chunk was in flight and replayed them after attaching. Do not bring that
 * back: re-entering ComfyUI's own graph-configured path a second time drives
 * the frontend's Vue node adapter (extractVueNodeData) to re-wrap the node's
 * `widgets` accessor on every pass, and the resulting getter chain overflows
 * the stack, which aborts the whole workflow load. The replay bought nothing
 * that the widget re-read does not already cover.
 *
 * The one thing genuinely lost is an `onExecuted` that arrives inside the load
 * window -- a prompt finishing in the moment a node is first placed. That is
 * narrow enough to accept.
 */

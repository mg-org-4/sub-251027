# OmniCam Motion Conformance

A Monitor profile passing its socket/schema contract (`Contract` in
[COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md)) only proves representation compatibility.
It does not prove that a real downstream model, fed OmniCam's output, produces a
video whose camera actually moves the way the scene described.

This document defines how that second claim — **Model Certification** — is
earned, and records where each profile stands.

## Status

The Monitor node itself is `is_experimental=True`.

**No profile is certified.** Every Monitor profile is `PENDING` /
`EXPERIMENTAL` for real-model motion until evidence lands in
`tests/conformance/results/` and its row here moves to `CERTIFIED`.

**Real-model certification is post-release work, not a release blocker.** The
first release ships every Monitor profile experimental and uncertified, by
design: the unit-parity and socket-contract gates below run in CI and gate the
release; the certification runs need real GPUs and model weights and are done
after release. Priority order when that work starts:

1. `wan_camera_native`
2. `h3_native`
3. `h3_api`

then the remaining profiles. Until a row moves to `CERTIFIED` here with
committed evidence, the profile stays labelled experimental everywhere.

| Profile | Model Certification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| external_reference_video | PENDING | none |
| wan_camera_native | PENDING | none |
| wan_move_native | PENDING | none |
| wan_track_native | PENDING | none |
| wanvideo_ati | PENDING | none |
| ltx25_motion_track | PENDING | none |
| h3_native | PENDING | none |
| h3_api | PENDING | none |

## Test ladder

Real-model conformance sits on top of two cheaper gates that run in CI:

1. **Unit parity** — OmniCam's camera maths compared numerically against the
   downstream project's own maths, no model. For Wan:
   `tests/test_wan_native_golden.py` (translations vs `WanCameraEmbedding`
   presets) and `tests/parity/test_wan_camera_official_parity.py` (roll vs the
   `ClockWise` / `Anti Clockwise` presets, plus pan / tilt / orbit direction
   and sign). A mirrored axis or dropped sign fails here.
2. **Socket / schema contract** — the profile emits what the downstream node
   accepts (`Contract` in [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md)).
3. **Model Certification** — this document: a real model actually moves the way
   the scene described.

Gates 1 and 2 run in CI and gate the release. Gate 3 does not: it is scheduled
after release (see **Status**). Passing 1 and 2 is a prerequisite for a
certification run, not a substitute for one.

## Cases

`tests/conformance/cases.json` (`majoor.omnicam.conformance.cases.v1`) lists the
camera cases and the profiles under test. Cases cover the primitive moves
(static, dolly, truck, pan, tilt, crane, orbit, roll), dynamics (accelerate,
decelerate), `parallax`, and `multi_shot_cut`.

## Result format

One JSON file per `(profile, case, seed)` run, under
`tests/conformance/results/`, shaped as
`majoor.omnicam.conformance.result.v1`:

```json
{
  "format": "majoor.omnicam.conformance.result.v1",
  "profile": "wan_camera_native",
  "omnicam_commit": "REAL_TESTED_COMMIT",
  "comfyui_version": "0.34.0",
  "downstream_node": "WanCameraImageToVideo",
  "model": "REAL_MODEL_AND_REVISION",
  "case": "truck_left",
  "input": { "duration_seconds": 3.0, "fps": 24.0, "width": 832, "height": 480 },
  "observed": {
    "runtime_error": false,
    "direction": "left",
    "timing": "pass",
    "framing": "pass",
    "parallax": "pass",
    "appearance_leakage": "not_applicable"
  },
  "status": "PASS"
}
```

`REAL_TESTED_COMMIT` and `REAL_MODEL_AND_REVISION` are placeholders in this
template only. A committed result file must carry real values. No agent may
fabricate a conformance result.

## PASS criteria

A single run is `PASS` only when:

- `runtime_error` is `false`;
- `direction` is correct;
- the sign of the move is correct;
- `timing` is acceptable (the move happens across the shot, not all in frame 1);
- `framing` is not inverted;
- the produced frame count is accepted by the downstream node;
- the produced dimensions are accepted.

For reference-video profiles additionally:

- proxy appearance leakage is `none` or `acceptable` (the generated result
  copies camera motion, not the neutral proxy's look).

## Stochasticity

When one run is ambiguous, run three seeds (A, B, C) and keep all three result
files. Directional certification needs at least **2 of 3** correct.

## Minimum certification set

A profile moves to `CERTIFIED` only after passing at least these cases.

### external_reference_video, h3_native, h3_api

### wan_move_native, wan_track_native, wanvideo_ati, ltx25_motion_track

```text

## Definition of done for this gate

Each profile is presented as exactly one of:

- `CERTIFIED` — minimum set passed, result files committed, row above updated;
- `PENDING` / `EXPERIMENTAL` — shown as such everywhere it is listed.

A profile with no evidence must never be presented as `CERTIFIED`.

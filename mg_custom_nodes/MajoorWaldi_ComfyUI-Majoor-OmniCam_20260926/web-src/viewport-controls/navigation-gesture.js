// The one place that decides what a viewport pointer gesture means. Everything
// else in the viewport only asks "is this navigation?" (so picking, the
// marquee and the gizmos can stand down) and "which of orbit/pan/dolly?".
//
// Alt is an ALIAS here, never the only way in. Real Maya gates every camera
// gesture behind it (Alt+left tumbles, Alt+middle tracks, Alt+right dollies)
// and that is honoured below -- but Alt never reaches the page in a number of
// real setups: a Linux window manager that claims Alt+drag to move windows, a
// desktop shell that opens its menu bar on Alt, a keyboard whose right Alt is
// AltGr (it reports Ctrl+Alt, not Alt). A viewport whose only orbit lives
// behind Alt is simply not navigable there, so every gesture has at least two
// independent bindings and none of the primary ones needs Alt:
//
//   orbit  middle drag          | Alt+left   | Ctrl+left over empty space
//   pan    Shift+middle         | Alt+middle | Alt+Shift+left, Ctrl+Shift+left
//   dolly  Ctrl+middle, wheel   | Alt+right (Maya) | Alt+Ctrl+left
//
// The middle-button family is Blender's, needs no modifier at all, and is what
// the timeline and curve editor in this same node already use to pan -- so it
// is the profile-independent baseline. The Ctrl+left fallbacks exist for
// hardware with no middle button, and only ever fire over empty space: the
// marquee declines Ctrl (multi-select is Ctrl+*click*, which still picks),
// which is what leaves that drag free. Alt+right stays Maya-only, since
// Blender binds no camera gesture to the secondary button.
//
// The "simple" profile is the mouse-only fallback: a bare left drag orbits, a
// bare right drag pans, the wheel dollies (as it does everywhere), and nothing
// needs a modifier or the middle button. Bare left is still deferred to
// navigationGesture -- exactly like the Ctrl fallback -- so a stationary click
// reaches the picker and can still select. All the modified Maya/Blender
// bindings stay live underneath it for anyone who wants them.

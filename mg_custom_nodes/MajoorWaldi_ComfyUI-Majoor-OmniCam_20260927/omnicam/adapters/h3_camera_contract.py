"""Complete H3 scene-coverage prompt renderer.

Turns an :class:`~omnicam.adapters.h3_geometry.H3GeometryAnalysis` into the
full H3 prompt document (subject/summary/retention/detailed description/
soundscape/music sections). The ``detailed_description`` section is the
enforceable camera contract: reference anchor, camera-vs-subject framing,
target/lens stability, direction, completion, parallax, the mapped segment
schedule, closure (when eligible), forbidden changes and the artist prompt.

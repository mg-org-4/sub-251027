"""Bridge ComfyUI's cooperative interruption into OmniCam's solve control.

A queued Extractor solve is cancelled through ComfyUI's Jobs API. ComfyUI
surfaces that to a long-running node when it polls
``comfy.model_management.throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted()``, which
raises ``InterruptProcessingException``.

OmniCam's solvers already poll a :class:`SolveControlProtocol` (``.checkpoint()``)
at every bounded wait -- the OpenCV frame loop, the DPVO child poll loop, the
pycolmap registration loop. :class:`ComfyInterruptControl` is such a control
backed by ComfyUI's interruption, so a Comfy job cancel travels the exact same
cooperative-stop / bounded-join / terminate / kill / cleanup path a manual stop
already does, and the DPVO child is reaped the same way.

Import-safe without ComfyUI: the primitive is resolved lazily and, when
``comfy`` is absent (or its import fails, e.g. a CPU-only torch build),
:func:`check_interrupted` is a silent no-op so the pure test suite still runs.

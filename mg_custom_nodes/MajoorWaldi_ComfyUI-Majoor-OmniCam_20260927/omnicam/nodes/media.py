"""One socket that accepts a ComfyUI ``VIDEO`` or an ``IMAGE`` batch.

Every OmniCam media socket is a ``MultiType`` union rather than a single type,
because the footage a camera track describes reaches a graph both ways: as a
decoded clip from a loader, and as the frame batch a generator just produced.
Forcing an ``ImageToVideo`` node in between bought nothing -- the conversion is
mechanical -- so it happens here instead, once, at the node boundary.

The coercions are deliberately asymmetric:

* an ``IMAGE`` becomes a VIDEO in memory, with no file behind it;
* a VIDEO becomes an ``IMAGE`` by *sampling*, never by decoding the whole clip;
* the extractor needs a real file to seek in, so :func:`solve_source` encodes an
  ``IMAGE`` batch into ComfyUI's managed temp storage before solving it.

A bare ``IMAGE`` batch carries no timing, so :data:`DEFAULT_IMAGE_FPS` names the
rate one is read at. A node that already knows the graph's frame rate should
pass its own.

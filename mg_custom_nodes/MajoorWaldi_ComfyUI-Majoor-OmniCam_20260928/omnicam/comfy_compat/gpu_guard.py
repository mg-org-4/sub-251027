"""Generic, throttled GPU-contention probe.

Any OmniCam subsystem that hands the GPU to work outside ComfyUI's own prompt
queue (DPVO's SolveControl, and reconstruction's provider inference) needs the
same protection: ComfyUI does not know a card is spoken for, so a workflow
queued mid-solve reloads a checkpoint straight into VRAM the child is already
using. Nobody wins that race; both sides OOM.

Two ways to lose that race, two checks:

- At *admission*: refuse to even start while the queue is running. One-shot,
  cheap, and it stops the common case outright.
- *Mid-run*: the admission read is stale the instant a workflow queues a
  moment later, so a running job has to keep asking -- at points it chose,
  throttled, so the check costs nothing between them.

This module holds only the throttling/probing primitive itself; job-specific
wiring (which exception to raise, when to arm, what state transition follows)
belongs to the caller. See how ComfyInterruptControl in comfy_compat/interrupt.py wraps
DPVO-specific sibling this generalizes from -- deliberately not rebuilt on top
of this shared primitive, so its already-tested behavior stays exactly as it
was.

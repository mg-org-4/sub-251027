// What the Monitor's Playblast player should actually show.
//
// `upstream-preview.js` reads whatever media element an upstream node has
// already rendered into its own DOM -- for the Director, that is its 3D
// viewport canvas, because the Director never keeps a `<video>` element
// around for the clip it just recorded. That fallback is honest for a
// third-party node whose output only exists once the graph runs; pointed at
// the Director it silently substitutes edit-time helpers, gizmos and the
// working camera for the clean, recorded proxy the compiled profile actually
// sends downstream.
//
// The Director already resolves this correctly for itself: `recording_path`
// is a widget kept in sync with the exact managed file `director.py` reads
// for its `playblast_video` output (see `serializeEditorState` in
// `state-sync.js`, mirrored here rather than re-derived, so the two can only
// drift by one of them being edited without the other). Reading it directly
// is both simpler and more honest than reconstructing the same answer from
// rendered pixels.

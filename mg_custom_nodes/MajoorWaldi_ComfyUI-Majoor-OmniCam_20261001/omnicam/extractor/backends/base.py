"""The contract every camera-motion solver has to honour.

The pipeline never learns which solver ran. It gets camera-to-world poses in a
basis the backend *declares*, plus a coverage number, and converts once. A
backend that quietly returned world-to-camera poses would mirror the whole
trajectory, which is why the basis and the direction are part of the protocol
rather than a comment.

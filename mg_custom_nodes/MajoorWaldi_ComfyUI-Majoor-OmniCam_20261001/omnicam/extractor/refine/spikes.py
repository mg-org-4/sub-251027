"""Finding the frames where a solve visibly broke.

The hard part is not detecting large steps -- it is *not* detecting a camera
that is simply moving fast. A whip pan produces big deltas on every frame, and
a mean/standard-deviation test would flag the whole shot.

So the statistics here are robust: median and MAD, which a handful of outliers
cannot drag around, plus a ratio floor so a sample has to stand out from the
shot's own typical step, not merely from zero. A constant-speed move has every
delta at the median and is therefore never flagged, however fast it is.

"""The ComfyUI V3 API surface OmniCam builds on, resolved defensively.

``comfy_api.latest`` is the moving in-development surface. OmniCam prefers the
explicit numbered ``comfy_api.v0_0_2`` module when it exposes a symbol and
falls back to ``latest`` per symbol. Upstream still marks v0_0_2
``STABLE = False``, so this is a compatibility boundary, not an ABI guarantee.
A naive pin to either one rots: ``latest`` may drop or rename a symbol between
releases, while the versioned module does not re-export every symbol the same
way (``v0_0_2`` exposes ``VideoComponents`` only through ``Types``, never at
top level).

So this module is the shock absorber. Each name is resolved on its own, from the
versioned API first and ``comfy_api.latest`` only as a fallback, so a
symbol that is missing or relocated in one place is still found in the other.

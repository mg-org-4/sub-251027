"""😺NKD Audio Timeline — the Timeline with only its sound.

A separate NODE, but deliberately NOT a separate implementation. It speaks the exact same
`timeline` JSON, and everything below is imported from `nkd_timeline.py`: the parser, the
level envelope and the mixer. Cutting sound and cutting picture are the same arithmetic on
a different lane, and two copies of it would disagree within a month.

What it is FOR: pulling a stretch of sound out of a long take, laying several pieces
against each other, and easing in and out of the joins - without dragging a whole video
timeline (a monitor, filmstrips, mask lanes, resolution fitting) along for the ride.

# ComfyUI Depth Anything V3

## Installation

Three options, in order of speed → reliability:

1. **ComfyUI Manager (nightly, recommended)** — search for `ComfyUI-DepthAnythingV3` in the Manager and click Install **from the nightly version**. Do **NOT** use any numbered version like `0.2.4` — they are outdated.
2. **Manager via Git URL** — in ComfyUI Manager: "Install via Git URL" with `https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-DepthAnythingV3.git`.
3. **Manual (most reliable)**:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-DepthAnythingV3.git
   cd ComfyUI-DepthAnythingV3
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   python install.py
   ```

Use multi attention node for smooth video depth!

## Demo Videos

You can use the multi-view node to use the cross attention feature of the main class of models. This is done to have a more consistent depth across frames of a video.

You can reconstruct 3D point clouds!

Even from multiple views, with the option to either match them (with icp) or leave them to use the predicted camera positions. You also have a field on the point cloud to show you which view each point came from.

## Description

Depth Anything V3 is the latest depth estimation model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from visual inputs.

## Model Variants

| Model | Size | Features |
|-------|------|----------|
| DA3-Small | 80M | Fast, good quality |
| DA3-Base | 220M | Balanced quality and speed |
| DA3-Large | 350M | High quality, balanced |
| DA3-Giant | 1.15B | Best quality, slower |
| DA3Mono-Large | 350M | Optimized for monocular depth |
| DA3Metric-Large | 350M | Metric depth estimation |
| DA3Nested-Giant-Large | 1.4B | Combined model with metric scaling |

## Model Capabilities

Different models support different features:

| Feature | Small/Base/Large/Giant | Mono-Large | Metric-Large | Nested |
|---------|------------------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Sky Segmentation** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Camera Conditioning** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Multi-View Attention** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **3D Gaussians** | ✅* | ❌ | ❌ | ✅* |
| **Ray Maps** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

- ✅ = Fully supported
- ❌ = Not available (returns zeros/ignored)
- ⚠️ = Works but no cross-view attention benefit (images processed independently)
- ✅* = Requires fine-tuned model weights (placeholder in current release)

**Choose your model based on needs:**
- Need sky masks? → Use Mono/Metric/Nested (required for V2-Style normalization)
- Need camera conditioning? → Use Main series or Nested
- Processing video/multi-view? → Use Main series or Nested for consistency
- Single images only? → Any model works

## Workflow Tips

### For ControlNet Depth Workflows
1. Use **Mono** or **Metric** models (they provide sky segmentation)
2. Set **normalization_mode** to **V2-Style** (default)
3. Connect the `depth` output to your ControlNet node
4. Enjoy clean depth maps with proper sky handling!

### For 3D Reconstruction (Point Clouds)
1. Use any model (Mono/Metric recommended for sky filtering)
2. Set **normalization_mode** to **Raw**
3. Connect `depth` → `depth_raw`, `confidence` → `confidence`, `sky_mask` → `sky_mask` to **DA3 to Point Cloud**
4. Sky pixels will be automatically excluded if sky_mask is connected
5. **Important**: Point cloud nodes validate input and will raise an error if normalized depth is detected (prevents incorrect 3D output)

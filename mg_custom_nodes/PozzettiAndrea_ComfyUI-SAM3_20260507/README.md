# ComfyUI-SAM3

## Installation

Three options, in order of speed → reliability:

1. **ComfyUI Manager (nightly, recommended)** — search for `ComfyUI-SAM3` in the Manager and click Install **from the nightly version**. Do **NOT** use any numbered version like `0.2.4` — they are outdated.
2. **Manager via Git URL** — in ComfyUI Manager: "Install via Git URL" with `https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3.git`.
3. **Manual (most reliable)**:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3.git
   cd ComfyUI-SAM3
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   python install.py
   ```

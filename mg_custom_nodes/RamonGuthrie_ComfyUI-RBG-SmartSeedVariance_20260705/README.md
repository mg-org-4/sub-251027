## Advanced Seed Diversity Enhancement for ComfyUI ✨

Some generative models (like Z-Image Turbo and Qwen-Image) suffer from **limited seed variance** — changing the seed produces only subtle variations or nearly identical outputs. The **RBG Smart Seed Variance** node solves this by intelligently injecting controlled noise into text embeddings during generation, creating meaningful diversity while preserving your prompt intention.

## Feature List 🚀

- **7 Intelligent Presets:** Pre-configured variance levels from Subtle to Wild:

  - **🌱 Subtle** - Gentle diversity for fine-tuning
  - **🌿 Balanced** - Sweet spot for most use cases
  - **🪴 Creative** - Unlock more artistic variations
  - **🌳 Bold** - Significant structural changes
  - **🌴 Wild** - Maximum diversity for exploration (Note this might break your prompt, use with caution!)
  - **⚙️ Custom** - Fine-tune with percentage slider (0-100%)

- **Model-Specific Optimization:** Automatic adjustment for your architecture:

  - **Krea2**, **Z-Image Turbo**, **Ernie-Image**, **Qwen-Image**, **Flux (Dev/Schnell)**, **Wan**, **Chroma HD**, **SDXL** and more!

- **25 Direction Shift Patterns:** Apply structured artistic biases instead of pure random noise.
- **7 Spatial Fade Curves:** Control how noise fades across the embedding space.
- **Flexible Noise Injection Timing:** Control when variance is applied.
- **Prompt Token Protection:** Preserve specific parts of your prompt from noise.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RamonGuthrie/ComfyUI-RBG-SmartSeedVariance.git
    ```

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start conservative:** Begin with "Balanced" preset and adjust up/down based on results
- **Experiment with directions:** Each artistic direction creates unique aesthetic shifts - try them all!
- **Protect your keywords:** Use "First Half" protection if important prompt concepts are being overridden
- **Track your seed:** Use consistent seeds to compare variance effects side-by-side
- **Model matters:** Always select the correct model type for optimal results and to avoid over-correction
- **Combine strategies:** Mix direction shifts with fade curves and noise injection timing for sophisticated effects
- **Use custom mode:** Fine-tune with the slider when presets don't match your needs exactly
- **Chain more than one:** For advanced effects, you can chain multiple Smart Seed Variance nodes.
- **Share settings with the Community:** If you find a killer setting combination Export them and share with the open-source community.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Output looks exactly the same?**

- Increase preset to "Bold" or "Creative"
- Check that the node is connected to your conditioning
- Verify model type is correct for your actual model
- Try a different seed value

**Quality degraded or image broken?**

- Reduce preset to "Subtle"
- Enable prompt protection ("First Half" or "First Quarter")
- Switch direction shift to "🚫 None" to use pure random
- Try "Ending Steps" to limit variance timing to fine details only

**Getting strange/unexpected outputs?**

- Reduce shift_strength to 50-70%
- Try a different direction shift pattern
- Verify ComfyUI version compatibility

## Usage 🚀

To use the `RBG Smart Seed Variance` node, connect it between your KSampler and the Conditioning input. This allows the node to modify the conditioning based on your chosen variance settings.

## 🔧 Installation

### Step 1: Install ComfyUI

First, ensure you have ComfyUI installed. You can follow the [pre-built package guide](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started/pre_package) or the [manual installation guide](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started/manual_install).

Make sure your system meets these requirements:
- **Python 3.10+**
- **ComfyUI installed**

### Step 2: Install ComfyUI-Runware

You have two options to install this integration:

#### Option 1: Using ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)
First, ensure you have the `ComfyUI-Manager` custom node installed. If you don't have it or are using the beta ComfyUI desktop version, follow the instructions on this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

After installing ComfyUI-Manager, open it and click on "Custom Nodes Manager". Search for "Runware" or **"Runware.ai"** and then click on install or update. Finally, restart your ComfyUI. ✨

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Navigate to the custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd custom_nodes
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Runware/ComfyUI-Runware.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI-Runware
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 3: Run ComfyUI

Install latest ComfyUI frontend package
```bash
pip install -U comfyui-frontend-package
````

Start ComfyUI with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Optional: CPU-Only Mode
If you want to run ComfyUI without a GPU, add the `--cpu` flag:
```bash
python main.py --cpu
```

### Step 4: Explore Workflows
Inside the `ComfyUI-Runware` custom node folder, you’ll find a `workflows` folder with pre-made workflows to get you started! 🚀

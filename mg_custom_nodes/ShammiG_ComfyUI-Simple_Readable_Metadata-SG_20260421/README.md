**Reason:** With new ComfyUI update, it changed the frontend from Lite graph rendering to Vue with **nodes 2.0**.         
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &nbsp; So, now it requires rewriting and troubleshooting with about 2000 lines of code!      
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &nbsp; which i am not currently leaned towards into.

# Update 2.5.0:       
By default, if comfyUI CLIP Text Encode Node's text box's input is connected, it will show up as (empty) in the Simple_Readable_Metadata output.         
These two fixes try to overcome that. **One for future, One for old.**          
● **Simple_Readable_Metadata_Save_Prompt_SG:** A **new node** for future workflows inject Positive prompt in metadata.                
Basically add this to the Final Text output just before the CLIP Text Encode Prompt Node's text box.                        
This will add the prompt to the metadata such that it is readable by Simple_Readable_Metadata.       
● **Implement Show All Text in Workflow:** A similar attempt to be able to see prompt from **old images** whose CLIP text encode box had input connected.         
This basically dumps all the text info present in the workflow, so you can look for prompts.         
● **Copy Positive Button in Text Viewer Node:** **Copies Positive Prompt directly** without the need to select it (bothered me personally a lot).           
Make sure to verify the final copied text.         
● **Added show_info options for display:** You can optionally show/hide properties, metadata or both.

# Update 2.0.0:
● **Added New Node: Simple_Readable_Metadata (Video):** Extract prompt, model used, lora used, scheduler, sampler, steps, CFG **now for mp4 and webm videos too**       
● **Updated Text Viewer to include font size:** Updated the text viewer, now you can select font size. [it's included from ComfyUI-Text Tools-SG](https://github.com/ShammiG/ComfyUI_Text_Tools_SG)          
● **added filename_output to all extracting nodes**

# Update 1.5.0:

**Added new node: Simple_Readable_Metadata_Save text** -- Save text in .txt or .json format (optional pretty json) [included Part of ComfyUI-Text Tools-SG](https://github.com/ShammiG/ComfyUI_Text_Tools_SG)
<br>
# Update 1.0.1: 

● **Added support for WEBP format:** Now also extracts and displays metadata from WEBP images.           
● **Filename and Filesize:** Also shows filename and filesize at the top, in the output of Simple_Readable_Metadata      
● **New output for filename:** New output for filename (can be connnected to SaveImage node or text viewer node.)

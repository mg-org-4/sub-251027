<details><summary>0.3.1 - 20 September 2026</summary>

### Fixed
- Stopped reinstalling the link and node draw overrides on every foreground draw. The install walks every property descriptor of the canvas and its LiteGraph prototypes to discover the methods it wraps, which measured ~6% of CPU during continuous pointer movement over a large workflow. The overrides are still reinstalled if the canvas or its prototypes are replaced.

<details><summary>0.3.0 - 28 April 2026</summary>

### Added
- Added a native `diagnostics` setting. Diagnostics remain disabled by default.

### Changed
- Began staged JavaScript refactor by extracting disabled-by-default diagnostics and resize-session ownership into dedicated modules.
- Extracted settings state, normalization, storage, and ComfyUI settings registration into a dedicated module.
- Extracted opacity animation state helpers while preserving the existing opacity feature.
- Extracted shared guideline rendering helpers for drawing bounds and snapped points.
- Extracted graph geometry and selection predicates into a dedicated helper module.
- Extracted graph node/group target resolution and identifier helpers into a dedicated module.
- Extracted selected node/group resolution and selected-interaction latch predicates into a dedicated module.
- Extracted graph/screen coordinate conversion and node/group hit-test helpers into a dedicated module.
- Extracted Ctrl/Meta crosshair visibility policy from the interaction-state resolver.
- Extracted input/connection tracking helpers for interactive controls, link drags, slot hitboxes, graph event targeting, and multi-select state.
- Extracted pointer/reset/visual-clear interaction state mutations into a dedicated helper module.
- Extracted selected-node/group interaction latching into a dedicated helper module.
- Extracted DOM opacity/outline adaptation and draw-operation exemption bounds into a dedicated opacity adapter module.
- Extracted the main interaction-state reducer into a dedicated module with explicit dependencies.
- Extracted graph activity, resize-candidate, and resize-corner detection into a dedicated module.
- Extracted the DOM compatibility patch for the link-opacity setting input into a small settings DOM helper.
- Stabilized node resize sessions so the active resize target/corner is preserved across transient frame-state drops instead of being re-inferred every frame.

<details><summary>0.2.0 - 7 February 2026</summary>

### Added
- Added a `CTRL behavior` setting with options to show crosshairs, hide crosshairs, or ignore Ctrl/Meta (`off`) while moving/resizing an already-selected node or group.

### Fixed
- Fixed crosshairs appearing during Ctrl/Meta marquee multi-selection by explicitly suppressing guideline rendering while a selection rectangle is active.
- Updated the Crosshair color tooltip to document support for hex values with alpha (for example `#RRGGBBAA`).
- Improved global pointer-listener stability/performance by pruning stale (disconnected) canvas entries from the internal canvas registry.

</details>

<details><summary>0.1.2 - 6 February 2026</summary>

### Fixed
- Fixed intermittent extra crosshairs during group moves (especially after tab switching) by prioritizing explicit group interactions over node move targets during interaction-state resolution.
- Fixed stale crosshair interaction state persisting across tab switches by resetting pointer/interaction state on document `visibilitychange` when the page becomes hidden.

<details><summary>0.1.1 - 6 January 2026</summary>

### Fixed
- Fixed false connection-latch suppression when starting a node/group move near slot-label edges by releasing the slot latch as soon as real move/resize activity is detected without an active Comfy link-drag state.

</details>

<details><summary>0.1.0 - 6 January 2026</summary>

### Fixed
- Fixed Nodes 2.0 node-move guideline placement by converting global pointer `clientX/clientY` to canvas-local coordinates before graph-space conversion.
- Fixed Nodes 2.0 node-resize guideline flicker by adding a resize-session latch that preserves the active resize target/corner across transient frame-state drops.
- Fixed crosshairs appearing while multi-select modifier is active by tracking `Ctrl`/`Meta` state across pointer and keyboard events and suppressing guideline rendering while active.
- Fixed crosshairs appearing while dragging from node input slots to create links by treating input handles/proximity as connection drag state (same suppression path as output-link drags).
- Fixed settings panel labeling by using settings `category` arrays with the top-level label `Crosshair Guidelines`.
- Fixed crosshairs getting stuck hidden after dragging groups/nodes across another node's input/output slots by removing mid-drag connection-slot latching from interaction-state evaluation.
- Fixed Nodes 2.0 output-link drags intermittently showing crosshairs by adding connection-slot fallback hit detection when no node-body hit is present and by honoring immediate canvas link-drag state at pointer-down.
- Fixed output/input link drags started from slot label text (e.g., `STRING`) by expanding slot hit detection from point-only to slot-row/label hitboxes, improving consistency in both classic and Nodes 2.0.
- Removed redundant node-bounds recalculations in resize-candidate detection.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for all nodes is available in the `web/docs` directory of this repository. Each node has its own markdown file with comprehensive information about:
- Inputs and outputs
- Usage instructions
- Features and capabilities
- Technical details
- Tips and notes

The documentation is automatically loaded by ComfyUI when you access the help for any node, based on your locale settings.

## Installation

### Via ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)
Search for "Starnodes" in ComfyUI Manager and install

### Manual Installation
1. Open CMD within your custom nodes folder
2. Run: `git clone https://github.com/Starnodes2024/ComfyUI_StarNodes`
3. Restart ComfyUI

Find the nodes under "⭐StarNodes" category or search for "star" in the node browser.

### Wildcards
You will find the wildcards in the wildcards folder of your ComfyUI main folder. If you add your own just copy the new files to this location.

## Wildcard Rules in the Star Wildcards Node

### Basic Wildcard Syntax
- Wildcards are defined using double underscores: `__wildcard_name__`
- The node looks for text files in the `wildcards` folder of your ComfyUI installation
- When a wildcard is encountered, a random line from the corresponding text file is selected

### Folder Structure
- Wildcards can be organized in subfolders
- To use a wildcard in a subfolder, use the syntax: `folder\__wildcard_name__`
- The system will look for the file at `[ComfyUI base path]/wildcards/folder/wildcard_name.txt`

### Random Options
- You can use curly braces `{}` with pipe symbols `|` to choose randomly between options
- Example: `{option1|option2|option3}` will randomly select one of the options
- You can even include wildcards inside these options: `{__wildcard1__|__wildcard2__}`

### Nested Wildcards
- Wildcards can be nested within other wildcards
- The system supports up to 10 levels of recursion to prevent infinite loops
- When a wildcard contains another wildcard, the nested wildcard is also processed

### Seed Behavior
- The node takes a seed parameter that determines the randomization
- Each prompt input (1-7) uses a different seed offset to ensure variety
- Each wildcard within a prompt also gets a unique seed based on its position

### Error Handling
- If a wildcard file doesn't exist, the wildcard name itself is used as text
- If a wildcard file exists but is empty, the wildcard name is used as fallback
- If there's an error processing a wildcard, it falls back to using the wildcard name

The Star Wildcards node allows you to combine up to 7 different prompts, each with their own wildcards, which are then joined together with spaces to create the final output string.

- Supports recursive wildcard processing up to 10 layers

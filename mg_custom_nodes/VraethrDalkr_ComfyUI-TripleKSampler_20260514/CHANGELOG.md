# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.5] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **WanVideoWrapper INPUT_TYPES() crash (issue #11)**
  - Fixed startup crash when WanVideoWrapper directory exists but node not fully loaded
  - Use NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS runtime lookup instead of import-time verification
  - Corrected fallback values to match actual WanVideoWrapper API
  - Added regression tests to prevent future crashes

## [0.10.4] - 2025-11-14

### Changed
- **Debug logging improvements in Advanced nodes**
  - Removed redundant "Models:" line from TripleWVSampler debug output (always shows same model types)
  - Removed redundant "Loaded config defaults" line (base_quality_threshold already shown in parameters)
  - Added dry_run status to debug output for better visibility
  - Cleaner, more concise debug logging focusing on relevant information

## [0.10.3] - 2025-11-14

### Changed
- **Comprehensive documentation updates**
  - Updated README.md with TripleWVSampler node descriptions and refined strategy documentation
  - Updated wiki: Installation Guide, Parameter Reference, Model Switching Strategies, Advanced Features, Troubleshooting, Development Guide
  - Added WanVideoWrapper integration documentation
  - Clarified refined strategies as theoretical optimization (may not produce perceptible differences in most workflows)
  - Improved terminology consistency throughout documentation

### Fixed
- **Code documentation consistency**
  - Updated module docstrings to reflect current strategy counts (Simple: 5 strategies, Advanced: 8 strategies)
  - Fixed test file docstrings for new module structure (shared/ modules)
  - Updated inline comments to match refactored architecture

## [0.10.2] - 2025-11-14

### Fixed
- **Critical WanVideo registration bug breaking sample passing between stages (issue aec0e66)**
  - Root cause: Import-time verification in wvsampler_nodes.py (commit 2e51d5e) broke WanVideo initialization order
  - Symptom: Memory usage dropped from ~1.8GB (correct chained samples) to ~0.1GB (broken - fresh noise generated each stage)
  - Solution: Filesystem-gated registration in __init__.py with case-insensitive directory search
  - No import-time verification calls that trigger premature initialization
  - Evidence of fix: Stage 2 memory 1.235 GB ✓ (was 0.063 GB), Stage 3 memory 1.824 GB ✓ (was 0.079 GB)
  - Quality restored to baseline (was degraded)
- **Unit test isolation improved with structured model mocks**
  - All unit tests now use mock_model_factory fixture instead of bare MagicMock objects
  - Provides proper model structure (model.model.model_config) expected by ModelSamplingSD3
  - Reduces test pollution failures from 28 to 26 tests
  - All 204 unit tests pass when run separately, all 110 integration/regression tests pass

## [0.10.1] - 2025-11-11

### Added
- **Automatic sigma_shift refinement for boundary-based strategies (strategy-based activation)**
  - Adaptive bidirectional search algorithm starting from user's initial shift value (~20-50x faster than zero-start)
  - Perfect alignment between switch step and target boundary sigma
  - Supports all node variants: TripleKSampler, TripleKSamplerAdvanced, TripleWVSampler, TripleWVSamplerAdvanced
  - Works with both ComfyUI samplers (KSampler nodes) and WanVideo schedulers (WVSampler nodes)
  - Algorithm inspired by ComfyUI-WanMoEScheduler's iterative search approach (MIT License)
  - **New refined strategy variants** for better discoverability:
    - Advanced nodes: 8 strategies (add "T2V boundary (refined)", "I2V boundary (refined)", "Manual boundary (refined)")
    - Simple nodes: 5 strategies (add "T2V boundary (refined)", "I2V boundary (refined)")
    - Strategy utility nodes: Updated to match (SwitchStrategySimple: 5, SwitchStrategyAdvanced: 8)
    - Refined strategies auto-activate refinement (no config flag needed)
    - Toast notifications include refined shift in compact format: `(σ-shift: 5.00→6.94)`
  - Configuration options in `config.example.toml`:
    - `search_interval = 0.01` (precision control, smaller = more precise)
    - `tolerance = 0.001` (sigma matching threshold)
  - Info logging shows refinement: `"Refined sigma_shift: 5.0 → 6.94 for perfect alignment at step 4"`
  - Dry-run mode displays refinement in toast notification

### Changed
- **Sigma shift refinement activation changed from config-based to strategy-based**
  - Removed `enabled = false` flag from config.example.toml (no longer needed)
  - Refinement now activates automatically when refined strategy variant is selected
  - Better UX: refinement options visible in dropdown, per-node control, no hidden config flags
  - 100% backward compatible: refined strategies added at END of dropdown lists (existing workflow JSON indices unchanged)
- **Refined sigma shift display improved in toast notifications**
  - Refinement info now appears on separate indented line for better readability
  - Changed wording from "σ-shift: X→Y" to "σ-shift refined: X → Y" (clearer, better spacing)
- **Sigma shift refinement algorithm simplified and improved**
  - Removed user-facing config parameters (`search_interval`, `tolerance`) from config.example.toml
  - Algorithm now always finds the actual closest sigma match (removed premature tolerance early-exit checks)
  - Search interval hardcoded to optimal value (0.01 sigma units per iteration)
  - Configuration simplified: only essential user-facing settings remain in config file

### Changed
- **Improved WanVideo wrapper UX when ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper not installed**
  - Reduced 6 repetitive warning messages to single clear INFO message at startup
  - Message now includes installation URL: `https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper`
  - TripleWVSampler nodes only appear in UI when dependency is actually installed
  - Node tooltips simplified (dependency mention redundant when nodes visible)
- **Added consistent parameter tooltips to TripleWVSampler nodes**
  - Added `seed` and `sigma_shift` tooltips matching TripleKSampler conventions
  - Ensures consistent UX across all node variants

### Fixed
- **WVSampler strategy matching for refined variants**
  - Fixed TripleWVSampler nodes falling back to "50% of steps (fallback)" when using refined strategies
  - Strategy checking now correctly strips "(refined)" suffix before matching against base strategies
  - Affects: TripleWVSampler (Advanced) and TripleWVSamplerAdvanced nodes
- **Dynamic UI parameter visibility for refined strategies**
  - Fixed JavaScript UI not hiding/showing optional parameters correctly for refined strategy variants
  - Refined strategies now behave identically to their non-refined counterparts for parameter visibility
  - Example: "T2V boundary (refined)" now hides both switch_step and switch_boundary like "T2V boundary"
- **Fixed WVSampler parameter passing after conditional registration refactor**
  - Added `batched_cfg` and `rope_function` to `sample()` method signatures in both advanced.py and simple.py
  - Parameters were in required INPUT_TYPES but missing from method signatures after fallback removal
  - Ensures proper parameter flow: ComfyUI → sample() → WanVideoSampler.process()

## [0.10.0-dev] - 2025-11-10

### Changed
- **Symmetric architecture refactoring: Unified TripleKSampler and TripleWVSampler structure**
  - Renamed module hierarchy for clarity and consistency:
    - `triple_ksampler/core/` → `triple_ksampler/shared/` (truly shared utilities)
    - `triple_ksampler/nodes/` → `triple_ksampler/ksampler/` (TripleKSampler-specific)
    - Created `triple_ksampler/wvsampler/` for TripleWVSampler nodes
  - Extracted WanVideo wrapper into symmetric module structure:
    - `wvsampler/base.py` (~840 lines) - TripleWVSamplerAdvancedAlt

  - Both node types now follow identical structural patterns:
    - Shared utilities in `triple_ksampler/shared/`
    - Type-specific nodes in `ksampler/` and `wvsampler/`
    - Symmetric file organization (base.py, advanced.py, simple.py)
  - **INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING ONLY**: Zero breaking changes for users
    - ComfyUI NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS keys unchanged
    - All node interfaces and behavior preserved
    - All 258 tests passing

- **Major internal refactoring: Improved code organization and maintainability (Phase 1-3)**
  - Reorganized node classes into focused modules (`triple_ksampler/ksampler/` package)
    - `base.py` (389 lines) - TripleKSamplerBase with core algorithm
    - `advanced.py` (557 lines) - Advanced node variants
    - `simple.py` (132 lines) - Simplified node
    - `strategy_nodes.py` (111 lines) - Strategy utility nodes

    - Created 7 focused modules: strategies, alignment, validation, config, logging, models, notifications
    - Added 156 comprehensive unit tests (100% coverage on critical functions)
  - Reduced file sizes significantly:
    - `ksampler_nodes.py`: 1168 → 114 lines (90% reduction, primary entry point)
    - `wvsampler_nodes.py`: 1327 → 110 lines (91% reduction, primary entry point)
  - Eliminated ~407 lines of code duplication (370 in nodes.py, 37 in nodes_wanvideo.py)

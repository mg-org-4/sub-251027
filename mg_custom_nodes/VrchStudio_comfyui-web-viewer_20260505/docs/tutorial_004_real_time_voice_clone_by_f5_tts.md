## How to Use

### 1. Run Workflow in ComfyUI

1. **Open the Workflow**  
   - Import the [example_web_viewer_005_audio_web_viewer_f5_tts](https://github.com/VrchStudio/comfyui-web-viewer/blob/main/example_workflows/example_web_viewer_005_audio_web_viewer_f5_tts.json) workflow into ComfyUI.

2. **Record Your Voice**  
   - In the **`Audio Recorder @ vrch.ai`** node:
     - Press and hold the **[Press and Hold to Record]** button.
     - Read aloud the text in `Sample Text to Record` (for example):
       > This is a test recording to make AI clone my voice.
     - Your recorded voice will be automatically sent to the **`F5-TTS`** node for processing.

3. **Trigger the TTS**  
   - If the process doesn’t start automatically, click the **[Queue]** button in the **`F5-TTS`** node.
   - Enter custom text in the `Text To Read` field, such as:
     > I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.  
     > All those ...  
     > moments will be lost in time,  
     > like tears ... in rain.

4. **Listen to Your Cloned Voice**  
   - The text in the **`Text To Read`** node will be read aloud by the AI using your cloned voice.

5. **Enjoy the Result!**  
   - Experiment with different phrases or voices to see how well the model clones your tone and style.

### 2. Use Your Cloned Voice Outside of ComfyUI

The **`Audio Web Viewer @ vrch.ai`** node from the [**ComfyUI Web Viewer**](https://github.com/VrchStudio/comfyui-web-viewer) plugin makes it simple to showcase your cloned voice or share it with others.

1. **Open the Audio Web Viewer page**:
   - In the **`Audio Web Viewer @ vrch.ai`** node, click the **[Open Web Viewer]** button.
   - A new browser window (or tab) will open, playing your cloned voice.

2. **Accessing Saved Audio**:
   - The `.mp3` file is stored in your ComfyUI `output` folder, within the `web_viewer` subfolder (e.g., `web_viewer/channel_1.mp3`).
   - Share this file or open the generated URL from any device on your network (if your server is accessible externally).

> **Tips:** Make sure your **Server** address and **SSL** settings in `Audio Web Viewer` are correct for your network environment. If you want to access the audio from another device or over the internet, ensure that the server IP/domain is reachable and ports are open.

### Example: SRT Format Stories

#### Story One

```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Little Deer opened her eyes as moonlight gently caressed the forest.
The woods at night were wrapped in a silvery veil, peaceful and enchanting.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
“Little deer, a star has lost its way,” whispered the owl from the tall oak tree,
his eyes glowing softly in the moonlight.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tiptoeing gently through the forest, Little Deer passed a sleeping hedgehog curled beneath leaves,
and a little fox smiling sweetly in his dreams.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Soon, little deer spotted a star gently floating on the lake,
glimmering quietly and rocking with the waves.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Little deer carefully waded into the water and whispered softly,
“Don’t be afraid, little star. I'll help you find your way back home.”

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She looked upward, where countless stars twinkled brightly in the velvet sky,
each gently waving, waiting for their lost friend to return.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Gently lifting the star back into the sky, little deer watched as it shone brighter,
joining friends that twinkled happily in thanks.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Little deer lay down softly beneath the tree, closed her eyes,
and drifted into sweet dreams, as the forest sparkled brighter than ever,
wrapping every animal in the gentlest sleep.
```

#### Story Two

```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As little rabbit opened her eyes, the moonlight softly touched the forest.
The night was quiet and calm, like a gentle lullaby.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
“Little rabbit, the forest is yours tonight,”
said a tiny firefly, glowing gently like a star.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She hopped through the woods, gently checking on her sleeping friends—
the hedgehog curled up tight, the little fox smiling sweetly.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Suddenly, rabbit saw the reflection of the moon in the pond,
but the little moon in the water was crying softly.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
“Don’t cry, little moon, I’m here,”
rabbit said, crafting a leaf boat and gently sailing toward the center.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She gently rocked the moon to sleep,
until the little reflection smiled again, shimmering happily.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Back on shore, rabbit looked up to the sky,
where the real moon smiled warmly down at them.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rabbit closed her eyes, cuddling softly beneath the trees.
Tonight, every animal slept peacefully under the gentle moonlight.

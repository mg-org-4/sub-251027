[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender?color=green)](https://github.com/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender/releases/latest)

This respository contains both custom nodes to be installed on the ComfyUI server and the Blender add-on to send workflows to the ComfyUI server. They can be used as follow:

* Create a workflow in ComfyUI **with the Blender nodes**.
* Run the workflow to confirm it executes properly.
* Export the workflow **in API format**.
* Import the workflow in the Blender add-on

The Blender add-on UI is automatically composed according to the input and output nodes used in the workflow.

## Setup

### ComfyUI Setup

Download and install ComfyUI. If you are new to ComfyUI, refer to the original [repository](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) to get started. **Make sure you have the latest version.**

At the time of writing this, the latest version was ComfyUI `v0.3.75`. This version required to update some of the ComfyUI-Blender nodes to the custom node schema v3. Making them incompatible with earlier versions of ComfyUI.

Install the ComfyUI-Blender nodes from the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager) or by cloning this repository in the custom nodes folder of ComfyUI:

```shell
cd ./ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender.git
```

If the ComfyUI server runs on a different machine than the Blender client, it must be started with the argument `--listen`. See ComfyUI documentation: [Setting Up LAN Access for ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/installation/comfyui_portable_windows#2-setting-up-lan-access-for-comfyui-portable).

### Install Blender Add-on

**Make sure you have a recent version of Blender.**

- The add-on has been updated to support Blender `v5.0` from version [`v4.0.0`](https://github.com/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender/releases) onward.
- The last version of the add-on to support Blender `v4.5` is [`v3.3.4`](https://github.com/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender/releases/tag/v3.3.4).

Download the add-on package `comfyui_blender_[...].zip` from the **[LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender/releases)**.

In Blender, go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Add-ons` > `Install from Disk` > select the zip package.

## Usage

For complete details about the various features, refer to the **[DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/alexisrolland/ComfyUI-Blender/wiki)**.

In a nutshell:

1. In ComfyUI, create a workflow using the Blender nodes (see workflow examples in this repository).

    * The Blender nodes are used to define the inputs and outputs to be displayed in the Blender add-on.
    * The title of the nodes are used as labels in the Blender add-on panel.

2. Run the workflow to confirm it executes properly.

3. Export the workflow JSON file **in API format**: Top Left Menu > `File` > `Export (API)`.

4. In Blender, import the workflow JSON file (make sure it is in API format): Press `N` > `ComfyUI` > `Import Workflow`.

4. Update the inputs and click on **Run Workflow**.

"""BFS Head Swap Sampler (LTX) — crop, mask and temporal loop in one node.

Everything is optional, so the node degrades to whatever you connect:

    guide_video                                   -> the LoRA over the whole clip, one pass
    + identity_image                              -> for a LoRA that takes a reference
                                                     (head swap, identity transfer)
    + subject_mask                                -> native inpainting: only the
                                                     masked region is denoised
    + crop_mode                                   -> the swap runs inside a stable
                                                     box around the subject and is
                                                     pasted back afterwards
    + temporal_tile_size < frame count            -> chunked sampling with overlap

The LoRA is never asked to understand a mask. It keeps doing its job (guide on
source_id 1, identity on source_id 2) and the mask acts through ComfyUI's own
inpainting path: `latent["noise_mask"]` reaches the guider as `denoise_mask`, so
pixels outside the mask keep the guide's own content and the original face is
never hidden from the model.

Why crop matters: at 512x288 a person filling a fifth of the frame leaves a face
about 25 px tall. No LoRA recovers identity from that. Cropping the head region
and sampling it full-frame gives the same face 200-300 px, then the result is
feathered back into the untouched frames.

The crop planner is vendored from drozbay's MaskVidExperiments (GPL-3.0, same as
this pack) in `bfs_subject_crop.py`, so nothing here depends on that pack being
installed. Its boxes hold still through mask noise and occlusion, which naive
per-frame crops do not, and a jittering crop reads to a video model as camera
motion.

    """The crop's size, before anything is sampled.

    The sampler derives its box from the mask, so the size to build the empty
    latent at is only knowable after a run -- which meant sampling a whole clip
    to read one number off the debug string, and doing it again after every
    change to the mask or the crop. This runs the same planner on the same
    inputs and hands the number over up front.

    Feed `width` and `height` straight into EmptyLTXVLatentVideo. Keep these
    three widgets identical to the sampler's: the planner is deterministic, so
    equal inputs give the same box, and a mismatch here means the sampler
    silently resizes the crop to a latent that does not fit it.

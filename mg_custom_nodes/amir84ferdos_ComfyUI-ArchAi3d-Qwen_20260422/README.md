## 📹 Camera Control

### Three Powerful Camera Nodes

The camera control system is based on extensive community research from Reddit r/StableDiffusion, optimized for Qwen Edit 2509.

#### 🎥 ArchAi3D Qwen Camera View
Professional viewpoint control for interior/exterior scenes:
- **6 movement types**: vantage point, tilt, combined movement, FOV, dolly, custom
- **Distance-based positioning**: "10m to the left" (more reliable than degrees)
- **FOV presets**: Normal, wide 100°, ultrawide 180°, fisheye
- **Scene-aware**: Optimized for interior/exterior/environment-only
- **Best for**: Room exploration, architectural walkthroughs, FLF video generation

#### 🔄 ArchAi3D Qwen Object Rotation
Orbit around objects using the proven "orbit around" technique:
- **Most reliable rotation method** (based on community testing)
- **Precise angle control**: 45°, 90°, 180°, 360° or custom
- **Multi-step mode**: Break 360° into multiple steps for better control
- **Subject-aware**: Specify what to orbit around
- **Best for**: Product visualization, 360° turntables, architectural flyarounds

### 📚 Documentation

**Comprehensive guides included:**
- [CAMERA_CONTROL_GUIDE.md](CAMERA_CONTROL_GUIDE.md) - Full guide with examples and workflows
- [PROMPT_REFERENCE.md](PROMPT_REFERENCE.md) - Quick prompt reference with reliability ratings

### Key Insights from Research

✅ **What Works Best:**
- "Orbit around" is THE most reliable term for rotation
- Environment-only scenes (no people) are most predictable
- Distance-based movement ("10m to left") beats arbitrary degree rotations
- "Dolly" is most consistent for zoom operations

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- Left/right in prompt = picture left/right, NOT subject's perspective
- Model may rotate people instead of camera if they're in frame
- Centered subjects work better than off-center
- Angles may not be exact, but direction is always consistent

### Simple Camera Workflow

```
1. Load your scene image
   ↓
2. ArchAi3D Qwen Camera View
   ├─ Choose movement type (vantage_point recommended)
   ├─ Set direction and distance
   ├─ Add scene description
   └→ Get camera prompt
   ↓
3. Connect to Qwen Encoder
   └→ Generate new viewpoint!
```

### 360° Object Rotation Workflow

```
1. Load your object/building image
   ↓
2. ArchAi3D Qwen Object Rotation
   ├─ Subject: "the building" / "the product"
   ├─ Angle: 360
   ├─ Multi-step: true (4-8 steps)
   └→ Get rotation prompts
   ↓
3. Loop through each step with Qwen Encoder
   └→ Generate 360° turntable!
```

## 👤 Person Perspective Control (NEW!)

### Specialized Node for People/Character Photography

Based on Reddit community research, the **ArchAi3D Qwen Person Perspective** node is specifically designed for changing camera perspectives when photographing **people and characters**.

#### 🎭 Key Difference: Person vs Object

**Person Perspective** (this node):
- Changes the **camera viewing angle** (high/low/side)
- Person stays in same pose, camera moves up/down/around
- **Primary focus: Identity preservation** (keep face/clothes/pose identical)
- Creates psychological effects (vulnerability, power, intimacy)
- **Best for**: Portraits, fashion, character art

**Object Rotation** (separate node):
- **Orbits camera** around an object/building
- Shows different sides of the subject
- **Best for**: Products, buildings, 360° turntables

#### 🎯 6 Perspective Presets

1. **High Angle (Bird's Eye)** - Looking down → vulnerability, intimacy
2. **Low Angle (Worm's Eye)** - Looking up → power, heroic, monumentality
3. **Eye Level Front** - Straight on → balanced, neutral, approachable
4. **Side Profile** - Full side view → silhouette, distance, elegance
5. **Three-Quarter View** - 45° angle → depth with approachability (most versatile)
6. **Dutch Angle** - Tilted camera → tension, drama, artistic flair

#### 🔒 Identity Preservation Levels

- **Strict** (recommended): Keep face, clothes, hairstyle, pose 100% identical
- **Moderate**: Maintain appearance and clothing
- **Loose**: Keep subject recognizable
- **None**: No preservation (not recommended)

#### ⚡ Simple Person Perspective Workflow

```
1. Load your person/character portrait
   ↓
2. ArchAi3D Qwen Image Scale
   ├→ Scale for VL and latent
   ↓
3. ArchAi3D Qwen System Prompt
   └→ Choose "Portrait Photographer" or "Fashion Photographer"
   ↓
4. ArchAi3D Qwen Person Perspective
   ├─ perspective_preset: Choose angle (e.g., low_angle_worms_eye for heroic)
   ├─ identity_preservation: strict (keep everything identical)
   ├─ psychological_effect: power/vulnerability/etc
   ├─ scene_context: Add environment description
   └→ Get perspective prompt
   ↓
5. Connect to Qwen Encoder
   └→ Generate new perspective while preserving identity!
```

#### 💡 Best Practices

- ✅ **Always use "strict" identity preservation** for consistent results
- ✅ **Keep subject centered in frame** for best results
- ✅ **Use person-focused system prompts** (Portrait/Fashion Photographer)
- ✅ **Match psychological effect to angle** (high=vulnerable, low=powerful)
- ✅ **Enable background/lighting adaptation** for natural results

#### 📚 Complete Guide

For full details, examples, and advanced techniques, see:
- **[PERSON_PERSPECTIVE_GUIDE.md](PERSON_PERSPECTIVE_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide with all 6 presets, workflows, and troubleshooting

**Perfect for**: Portrait photography, fashion shoots, character concept art, editorial photography, heroic poses, emotional storytelling through camera angles

- **Auto-facing mode**: Automatically face your target subject
- **Perfect for**: "Go in front of some object and take a photo with that subject in front of camera view" ✅

```
Example: Position 2m to the right of espresso machine at face level
→ "modern kitchen, change the view to a vantage point at face level 2m
   to the right facing the espresso machine"
```

### 🎬 Camera View Selector (ArchAi3D_Qwen_Camera_View_Selector)

### 🎨 Colorization (ArchAi3D_Qwen_Colorization)
**Convert B&W to color with historical era context**

- **2 modes**: Auto (model chooses realistic colors) or Custom (specify "blue sky, green grass")
- **9 era presets**: 1900s, 1920s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, Victorian, Medieval
- **Skin tone preservation**: Maintains natural skin tones
- **Perfect for**: Family photo restoration, historical archives, vintage images, documentary work

```
Example: Colorize 1950s photo

## 🎨 Customizing Materials

The Room Transform Prompt node loads materials from `config/materials.yaml`. You can easily customize this file!

### Adding Your Own Materials

Edit `config/materials.yaml` and add new materials:

```yaml
floors:
  - name: "My Custom Floor"
    description: "my custom floor material (detailed description for AI)"
    tags: [bright_light, low_contrast]  # Choose from: rich_dark, bright_light, low_contrast, all
```

### Material Tags

Each material can have multiple tags for organization:
- **`rich_dark`** - Dark, dramatic materials (black, dark wood, navy, etc.)
- **`bright_light`** - Light, bright materials (white, cream, beige, etc.)
- **`low_contrast`** - Smooth, minimal texture (flat paints, polished surfaces)
- **`all`** - Always shown (use for "Keep Original" and "Custom")

### Example Custom Material

```yaml
floors:
  - name: "Weathered Reclaimed Wood"
    description: "weathered reclaimed wood planks (rustic, aged patina, natural variations)"
    tags: [rich_dark]
```

After editing the YAML file, restart ComfyUI to load the new materials.

### Multi-Language Support

You can create language-specific files:
- `config/materials_en.yaml` (English)
- `config/materials_es.yaml` (Spanish)
- `config/materials_fa.yaml` (Persian/Farsi)

Then modify the Python file to load the appropriate language file.

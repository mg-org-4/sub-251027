/**
 * #2143 — a widget name shared by several rows must be ADDRESSABLE, and the reply must say
 * which row was written.
 *
 * The reported node is an rgthree Fast Groups Bypasser matching two groups. It draws one
 * toggle row per matched group and names every one `RGTHREE_TOGGLE_AND_NAV`.
 * `panel_query_graph` has reported each row with a stable index and its own label since
 * #1402; `panel_set_widget` resolved by name alone and always took the first, so the second
 * group's toggle had no address at all. On a Bypasser that row's action changes the MODE of
 * every node in its group, so "which occurrence" is a graph mutation, not a label.
 *
 * The behavioural tests below drive the production-shaped row (toggle()/doModeChange(), no
 * widget.callback — the same shape #2146's suite models) through the real `applyWidgetWrite`,
 * and assert on the MODES that moved: an address for occurrence 1 must mute the SECOND
 * group's nodes and leave the first group's alone. Deleting the occurrence plumbing makes
 * those two assertions fail in opposite directions, which is the point — a test that only
 * checked "the write succeeded" would pass with the fix removed.

/**
 * #2158 — `panel_open_workflow` failed with a bare `NetworkError when attempting to
 * fetch resource.` and nothing else. No route, no classification, no statement of what
 * the failed switch left behind.
 *
 * ## What actually threw, read out of the frontend rather than guessed
 *
 * The panel's open executor calls the workflow STORE's `openWorkflow(target)`:
 *
 *     openWorkflow = async (workflow) => {
 *       if (isActive(workflow)) return workflow
 *       if (!openWorkflowPaths.value.includes(workflow.path))
 *         openWorkflowPaths.value.push(workflow.path)   // <-- store mutated HERE
 *       const loadedWorkflow = await workflow.load()    // <-- throws HERE
 *       activeWorkflow.value = loadedWorkflow           // <-- not reached
 *       comfyApp.canvas.bg_tint = loadedWorkflow.tintCanvasBg
 *       ...
 *     }
 *
 * `workflow.load()` bottoms out in `UserFile.load()`, which sets `isLoading = true` and
 * then `await api.getUserData(this.path)` — a plain `GET /userdata/<encoded path>`. On a
 * transport failure that fetch THROWS rather than returning a non-200, so the browser's
 * own string is what propagates: Firefox says `NetworkError when attempting to fetch
 * resource.`, Chrome `Failed to fetch`, Safari `Load failed`.
 *
 * Confirmed against BOTH the 1.47.2 source and the shipped 1.51.9 minified bundle, which
 * bracket the 1.49.6 the report came from.
 *
 * ## The two things the executor was getting wrong
 *
 * 1. It rethrew the browser's message verbatim. The panel already owns a classifier for
 *    exactly this failure class — `manager-fetch-failure.js`, built for comfyui-mcp#1472
 *    when `panel_install_node` failed the same bare way, whose table already carries
 *    Firefox's wording. It was simply never wired to the open path. This module reuses
 *    that classifier rather than growing a second copy of the table, so a browser whose
 *    wording is added there is understood here too.
 *
 * 2. It journaled `applied: false` and commented "nothing was applied". That is an
 *    ASSERTION, not a measurement, and `applied` is the load-bearing #402 field: the
 *    orchestrator turns `false` into "confirmed not applied by the panel's
 *    request-id-correlated receipt. It is safe to retry."
 *
 *    For the REPORTED failure that advice happens to be right — the call that threw is a
 *    GET, so nothing was written server-side and a retry is genuinely safe. But it is
 *    right by accident. The same catch also covers a throw from AFTER the pointer moved
 *    (`activeWorkflow.value` is assigned, then `comfyApp.canvas.bg_tint` is written, and
 *    a null canvas there throws). In that configuration the panel would tell the caller
 *    "confirmed not applied" while the active workflow HAS become the target — the
 *    wrong-graph hazard #968/#1111 exist to prevent, wearing the strongest phrasing in
 *    the vocabulary.
 *
 * So the verdict here is MEASURED. Where the panel can see that the active workflow is
 * still the one it started on, `false` stays `false` and the caller keeps the accurate
 * "safe to retry". Where the pointer moved, or where the panel could not observe it at
 * all, the answer degrades to `"unknown"` and the orchestrator tells the caller to
 * inspect before retrying. Both directions are strictly better than asserting.
 *
 * ## Why the tab residue is reported but does NOT change the verdict
 *
 * The push into `openWorkflowPaths` happens before the read, so a failed switch leaves
 * the target listed among the open tabs with no content behind it (`openWorkflows` is a
 * computed over that same array). That is a real, user-visible side effect and the
 * caller should be told about it — but it is not a reason to downgrade `applied`.
 * Downgrading would replace "safe to retry" with "inspect first" on the exact case this
 * issue is about, which is the caller's situation getting worse, not better. It belongs
 * in the prose, and that is where it goes.

// #2108 — a connect that silently OVERWRITES an unrelated link.
//
// The reporter repaired two invalid links on a live canvas. Each panel_connect
// reported success and also moved a wire it never named: "node 20 output 0 ->
// node 23 input 5 moved to the new link", then a different one on the next
// repair, until SamplerCustom was receiving MASK/VAE/SAMPLER in the wrong inputs.
// The #2380 collateral detector saw it and said so, which is why there is a
// report at all — but seeing it is not preventing it.
//
// THE MECHANISM, read out of the shipped frontend rather than guessed at. Every
// site that mints a link does this shape:
//
//     let o = toLinkId(Number(graph.state.lastLinkId) + 1);
//     graph.state.lastLinkId = o;
//     let s = new LLink(o, ...);
//     graph._links.set(s.id, s);
//
// `_links` is a Map and `set` REPLACES. So the moment `state.lastLinkId` sits
// below an id that is actually present, the next connect mints a colliding id and
// the bystander's record is replaced by the new one — which reads exactly as "an
// existing link moved to the new link". It also explains why each successive
// repair displaced a DIFFERENT wire: the counter keeps walking through ids that
// are already taken.
//
// A graph reaches that state by being loaded from something that did not carry a
// correct `last_link_id`: an API/prompt graph has no such field at all (panel#2011
// made that path loadable), and a hand-edited or third-party-exported workflow can
// carry one that is simply wrong.
//
// The repair is the frontend's OWN idiom. Its state-merge does
// `lastLinkId = max(lastLinkId, incoming)`; this does the same against the ids the
// graph actually holds, immediately before a mutation that is about to allocate.
// Nothing is renumbered and no link is touched — only the counter moves, and only
// upwards.

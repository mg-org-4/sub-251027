// ADDRESSING ONE OF SEVERAL WIDGETS THAT SHARE A NAME (#2143).
//
// `duplicateWidgetRows` (#1402, widget-rows.js) reports every widget that shares a name
// with another, each with a stable `index` and its own display `label`. Its own doc comment
// states the consequence plainly: "widgets are addressed by NAME, and a repeated name
// cannot be addressed unambiguously at all". That was true of the WRITE side too, and it is
// the whole defect this module closes: the read advertised an address the write could not
// take.
//
// The reported shape is an rgthree Fast Groups Bypasser matching two groups. It renders one
// toggle row PER MATCHED GROUP and names every one of them `RGTHREE_TOGGLE_AND_NAV`:
//
//   duplicate_widgets: { RGTHREE_TOGGLE_AND_NAV: [
//     { index: 0, label: "Enable VRAM optimizations 1", value: { toggled: true } },
//     { index: 1, label: "Enable VRAM optimizations 2", value: { toggled: true } } ] }
//
// `panel_set_widget {widget: "RGTHREE_TOGGLE_AND_NAV"}` resolved with
// `widgets.find(w => w.name === wanted)` — the FIRST occurrence, silently, with nothing in
// the reply naming which of the two rows was hit. The second group's toggle had no address
// at all, and on a Bypasser that row's callback is what changes the modes of the group's
// nodes, so "which occurrence" is a real graph mutation, not a cosmetic detail.
//
// TWO ADDRESSES ARE ADDED, both carried by the EXISTING `widget` string — no new tool
// argument, so no schema change on the comfyui-mcp side (#754 makes every panel_* schema
// `.strict()`, and an unknown key would simply be rejected):
//
//   "NAME[i]"   the i-th occurrence of NAME, counting in the same canvas order
//               `duplicate_widgets` reports. Composes with #560 sub-field addressing:
//               "NAME[1].toggled" is the `toggled` field of occurrence 1.
//   "LABEL"     the display label an occurrence carries, when exactly one widget on the
//               node carries it. This is the address the reporter actually reached for.
//
// EXACT-NAME-FIRST IS PRESERVED, for the same reason #560's dotted split preserves it: a
// widget whose own name is literally `foo[1]` still wins, and the bracket is only ever
// interpreted when NO widget carries the requested string. Likewise the label route runs
// LAST — after every name-based route, including the #524 case-insensitive fallback — so
// every address that resolved before this change resolves to the identical widget.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never invents an occurrence. An out-of-range index
// and an ambiguous label are both LOUD refusals that name the valid addresses, never a
// silent fall back to occurrence 0 — which is the defect, not the remedy.
//
// Dependency-free beyond `displayLabel` (no DOM, no LiteGraph). Unit-testable with plain
// fixtures, and resolved against the SAME `node.widgets` order `duplicateWidgetRows` reads.

/**
 * THE ONE DEFINITION of what an occurrence address resolves to, so the write and the

 * `duplicate_widgets` publishes — never an ordinal counted over same-named rows: the two
 * agree only when the duplicated name starts at widget 0, and disagreeing silently is how
 * the write lands on one row while the readback reports another (and, if that other row
 * happens to hold the requested value, acks an uncertain write as verified).
 *
 * Null unless the widget at that position still carries `name`. Beyond that, "is this
 * still the row that was addressed" is answered in the order of how much each answer
 * actually establishes, because the address is resolved before an await and used after it:
 *
 *   1. IDENTITY. `pin.widget` is the row object captured at resolution. If the object at
 *      this position is that object, this is definitively the same row — including when
 *      the rows carry no labels, or identical ones, where nothing else can tell them apart.
 *      If that object is still on the node but somewhere ELSE, the rows were REORDERED and
 *      the index is stale: null, so the write refuses rather than mutating a stranger.
 *   2. LABEL, and it must actually DISCRIMINATE. A rebuild that kept the same number of
 *      rows: a matching label says it put the same row back here, a different one says it
 *      did not — but a label shared by more than one same-named row says nothing at all,
 *      and neither does no label. Once the addressed OBJECT is gone, an inconclusive label
 *      is a REFUSAL, not a pass: the rows cannot be told apart, so writing one of them is a
 *      coin flip, and a coin flip that mutes the wrong group is this whole issue. The
 *      caller re-reads `duplicate_widgets` and addresses it again — cheap, and honest.
 *
 * A pin carrying only an `index` skips both (there is no object and no label to weigh) and
 * lands on name + position: the old behaviour, kept so a bare `{index}` stays usable in
 * fixtures and direct helper calls. Nothing the panel sends is that shape — it always pins
 * the row it resolved.
 *
 * The number of same-named rows is deliberately NOT a third test. It looks like independent
 * evidence and is not: when the label discriminates, the row it names IS the addressed row
 * however many siblings appeared beside it, so refusing on the count is a false refusal;
 * and when the label does not, step 2 has already refused.

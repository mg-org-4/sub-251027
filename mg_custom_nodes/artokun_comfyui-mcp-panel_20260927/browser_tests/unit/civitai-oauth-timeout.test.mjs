// #2044 — CivitAI sign-in failed silently.
//
// The popup ends on a bare browser 403 (ComfyUI's `create_origin_only_middleware`
// rejects the cross-site redirect back from CivitAI on the one branch that logs
// NOTHING), and on this side `_oauthPollIv` polled 120 times at 2s and then simply
// stopped. Four minutes, then nothing: no toast, no error, and an empty ComfyUI
// log. The user is left with a raw 403 and no statement that sign-in failed.
//
// The root cause is not fixed here and this file does not pretend otherwise —
// both real fixes are blocked (the loopback-PKCE route needs a CivitAI app
// registration test only the account owner can run; the middleware-insert route
// reaches into core's middleware list and was deliberately not shipped blind).
// What is fixed is the silence.
//
// Pinned on the shipped bundle: the timeout branch is reachable only after 240s of
// real polling, so a behavioural test would have to fake timers through a module
// that owns its own interval. What can be checked without that is that the branch
// EXISTS, says something, and — the part that matters — does not overclaim.

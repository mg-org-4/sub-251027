/**
 * comfyui-mcp#1707 — a promoted-widget write aimed at ONE subgraph instance must
 * not change the shared subgraph DEFINITION, which every sibling instance reads.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS BUILT FROM THE REAL FRONTEND SHAPE, not from a convenient
 * approximation. Read off comfyui-frontend 1.48.7 (`SubgraphNode.ts`,
 * `widgetValueStore.ts`, `widgetId.ts`, `ExecutableNodeDTO.ts` — the version the
 * reporter ran) and confirmed against a live 1.48.7 canvas:
 *
 *   * every instance of one reusable subgraph shares ONE `Subgraph` object, so the
 *     inner nodes and their widgets are shared too (`a.subgraph === b.subgraph`
 *     is TRUE for a cloned instance on a live canvas);
 *   * each instance's host input carries `widgetId = "<rootGraphId>:<nodeId>:<name>"`
 *     — the wrapper's OWN node id is in the key;
 *   * the rail widget litegraph projects for that input is a VIEW OF A STORE keyed
 *     by that id: `get value()` reads it, `set value()` writes it, and its
 *     `callback` writes it too (that callback is the only bridge a canvas edit
 *     takes — a canvas edit never touches the inner widget);
 *   * `_setWidget` SEEDS a newly promoted instance's store entry from the INNER
 *     widget's current value, which is how a definition write reaches a wrapper
 *     nobody addressed;
 *   * queue compilation reads `store[input.widgetId].value` for an unlinked
 *     promoted input and never reads the inner widget.
 *
 * A fixture that stored the rail value ON the rail object would pass whatever the
 * code did, because the two stores would be one store. The store below is the point.

// -------------------------------------------- #1492: the side effects it did NOT run

/**
 * #1492 — the REPORTED shape, on the same real frontend plumbing as the fixture above
 * (one shared `Subgraph`, one per-`widgetId` value store, a rail projection that is a
 * VIEW of that store) but with the inner widget the reporter actually had: a status
 * switch whose BOOLEAN `enabled` widget does not merely hold a value — its callback
 * flips ANOTHER node between ACTIVE and BYPASS.
 *
 * The ids are the report's own (wrapper 1512, inner switch 2448, switched node 2528),
 * because the whole defect is that a caller reading a clean success went and found
 * 2528 still where it was.

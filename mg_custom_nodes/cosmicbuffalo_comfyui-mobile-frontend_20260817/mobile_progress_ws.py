"""Push-based progress channel for the native app's Live Activity.

The node's own asyncio loop watches comfy_execution.progress's registry
in-process (a dict read, not a network call) and pushes a message to connected
clients the instant the value changes, so delivery latency is bounded by the
tick interval below rather than a client-chosen poll interval.

Scope stays narrow: this channel carries only the progress fraction. Queue
depth / isRunning stay on the `/queue` poll.

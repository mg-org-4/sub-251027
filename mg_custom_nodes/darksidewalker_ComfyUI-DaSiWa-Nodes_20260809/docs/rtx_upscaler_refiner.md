# DaSiWa: RTX Upscaler & Refiner

This node leverages NVIDIA RTX Video SDK features to provide professional-grade image/video enhancement directly within ComfyUI. It executes up to three sequential passes in a single node, processing frame-by-frame to keep VRAM usage predictable and low.

## ⚡ Processing Pipeline
The node executes effects in this order:
1.  **Denoise (Pass 1):** Cleans up grain and compression artifacts at the source resolution.
2.  **Deblur (Pass 2):** Sharpens focus and reduces motion blur at the source resolution.
3.  **Upscale (Pass 3):** Scales the image to the target resolution using AI (VSR) or High Bitrate processing.

## 📐 Resize Types Explained

Choosing the right `resize_type` is key to getting the correct output resolution:

*   **Same Size:** The node processes the input at its original resolution. Use this if you only want to Denoise or Deblur without changing the size.
*   **Scale:** Simply multiplies the current width and height by the `scale` value. For example, a 1080p image at 2.0x scale becomes 4K.
*   **Keep Ratio:** Calculates a new resolution that hits your `megapixels` budget while preserving the exact aspect ratio of the input image. Great for maintaining the "look" while increasing quality.
*   **Preset Ratio:** Targets the `megapixels` budget but forces the image into a specific shape (like `16:9` or `9:16`) regardless of the input. Use `resize_method` to decide if the image should be cropped or letterboxed to fit.
*   **Manual:** Allows you to set the exact `width` and `height` in pixels.

## 💎 Quality Levels (Low to Ultra)

RTX Quality settings control the complexity of the AI models used:
*   **Low / Medium:** Balanced for speed. Best for real-time previews or mid-range RTX cards.
*   **High:** Standard high-quality reconstruction.
*   **Ultra (Default):** Maximum parameter count models. Provides the cleanest edges and highest detail.

## ⚠️ When Results Can Look Worse

RTX VSR is an upscaler, not a detail recovery tool for material that has already been enlarged. If the input video was previously upscaled, heavily sharpened, denoised, or re-encoded, RTX VSR may enhance those artifacts instead of creating real new detail. This can look pixelated, smeared, or over-processed.

Check these settings first when users report degraded quality:

*   **Target resolution below input:** `Keep Ratio` uses the `megapixels` value. For example, a 4K input is about 8.3 MP, so `Keep Ratio` at `2.0` MP is a downscale and will look softer.
*   **Manual size below input:** Manual `1920x1080` on a 4K source is also a downscale.
*   **Divisibility too high:** `divisible_by=8` matches RTX VSR behavior and common video sizes like 3840x2160. Use `32` only for downstream nodes that require it, because standard 2160p is not divisible by 32.
*   **Aspect changes:** `Preset Ratio` and mismatched `Manual` dimensions intentionally crop or letterbox before upscaling. Use `Scale` or `Keep Ratio` when you want to preserve the source framing.
*   **Too many cleanup passes:** Denoise and Deblur can help poor sources, but on already clean video they may remove texture before the upscale pass.

## ⚙️ Key Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **upscale** | `VSR` is best for clean AI upscaling. `High Bitrate` is specifically tuned for sources that are noisy or heavily compressed. |
| **divisible_by** | Use **8** for RTX-style image/video upscaling. Use **32** only when the next model in the workflow requires it. |
| **resize_method** | When the source and target aspect ratios don't match: `Center Crop` fills the whole target frame by cutting edges; `Letterbox` fits the whole image inside and adds black bars. |
| **device_id** | If you have multiple GPUs, set this to the index of your RTX card (usually `0`). |

## 💡 Pro-Tips

*   **Refinement First:** If your source is very low quality, enable `denoise` or `deblur` alongside `upscale`. Cleaning the image before upscaling usually yields much sharper results.
*   **VRAM Management:** This node handles the output tensor pre-allocation efficiently. However, upscaling a long video batch to 4K still requires significant system RAM. If you hit OOM, try processing smaller batches or using `Keep Ratio` with a lower `megapixels` target.
*   **Div32 Snapping:** Even in `Manual` or `Scale` modes, `divisible_by=32` can slightly adjust your dimensions. That is useful for some video VAEs, but it can avoid standard output sizes such as exact 4K.

## CPU Batch Storage

CPU output batches use the currently available RAM reported by `psutil`, not a fixed RAM cap. The node reserves 25% of total RAM on systems below 32 GiB (minimum 1 GiB), rising smoothly to an 8 GiB maximum reserve on larger systems. It uses disk-backed temporary storage only when allocating the complete output batch would cross that reserve. The check runs at allocation time rather than at ComfyUI startup, so it accounts for models and other workloads loaded after startup. GPU outputs retain their separate 8 GiB VRAM safety limit.

## Overview

The **DaSiWa Watermark Overlay** is a professional-grade node designed for adding watermarks to images and video batches. It features high-quality bicubic resampling, precise rotation, and a stable CPU compositor for consistent frame-to-frame output.

## Key Features

- **Robust Batch Processing:** Stores output batches in system RAM and processes watermark regions frame by frame.
- **Stable CPU Compositing:** Initializes every output frame from the source image before blending the watermark region, avoiding uninitialized frames, CUDA fallback differences, and black-frame artifacts.
- **Dynamic Random Positioning:** Toggleable corner cycling that starts from the selected position, with a seed to keep chained nodes from matching unintentionally.
- **Dynamic Fade (Splash Mode):** Toggleable fade that brings the watermark in at the start and end of the sequence while keeping the middle clear.
- **Optical Padding:** Automatically adjusts the watermark's position based on its visual center of mass. This ensures that asymmetric or rotated watermarks look perfectly aligned relative to the edges.
- **Premultiplied Alpha Blending:** Premultiplies before scaling/rotation and clamps the result to avoid dark halos or black transparent backgrounds.
- **Bicubic Scaling:** Maintains sharpness and detail when resizing the watermark image.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `images` | IMAGE | The image or video batch to apply the watermark to. |
| `watermark_path` | Combo | Select or upload a watermark file (PNG with transparency is highly recommended). |
| `position` | Combo | Static placement, or the starting placement when `randomize_position` is enabled. |
| `scale` | FLOAT | Size relative to the input image width (e.g., 0.2 = 20% width). |
| `resampling` | Combo | The algorithm used to resize the watermark. **Bicubic** is the recommended default for quality. |
| `transparency` | FLOAT | Opacity of the watermark (1.0 = Opaque, 0.0 = Invisible). |
| `rotation` | INT | Rotation in degrees (0–359). Canvas expands automatically to prevent clipping. |
| `padding_x / y` | INT | Pixel offset from the chosen edge. |
| `optical_padding`| BOOLEAN | Enable centroid-based alignment for visual balance. |
| `random_switches` | INT | How many times the position should jump when `randomize_position` is enabled. |
| `fade` | BOOLEAN | Enable the splash branding effect. |
| `fade_margin` | FLOAT | Duration for the start and end fades as a percentage of total frames (0.1 = 10%). |
| `randomize_position` | BOOLEAN | Enable seeded corner cycling. |
| `random_seed` | INT | Seed for corner order. `0` derives a stable seed from the watermark file name. |

## Tips for Best Results

### Visual Centering
If your watermark has a significant shadow on one side or is a long string of text, standard corner alignment often looks "off." Enable **Optical Padding** to let the node calculate the visual center of the logo and nudge it into the perfect position.

### Anti-Cropping with Random Mode
Enable **randomize_position** to alternate between the four corners. The first interval uses the selected **position**, then the node jumps exactly the number of times specified in `random_switches` over the length of the batch. Use different start positions or different `random_seed` values when chaining multiple watermark nodes.

### Splash Branding with Dynamic Fade
Enable **fade** and set a **fade_margin** (e.g., 0.1 for 10%) to create a professional "splash" effect. The watermark will fade in over the first 10% of frames and reappear during the last 10%, remaining hidden in between.

### Stability and Memory
When working with 2K/4K video batches or complex LTX workflows, the node keeps the output batch in system RAM and uses one consistent CPU blend path. It preserves 25% of RAM on systems below 32 GiB (minimum 1 GiB), rising to an 8 GiB maximum reserve on larger systems, and only uses temporary disk-backed output when the complete batch would cross that reserve. This avoids frame-to-frame differences, fallback flicker, and black-border artifacts from device-path changes.

### High Quality Blending
The node automatically premultiplies the alpha channel before resizing and clamps the rotated result so transparent pixels stay transparent. This means you don't need to pre-process your logos in Photoshop; just provide a high-quality transparent PNG, and the node handles the math for a seamless overlay.

## Technical Details

- **Rotation:** Uses bicubic interpolation with an axis-aligned bounding box expansion.
- **Memory Strategy:** 
    1. Watermark is loaded, rescaled, and rotated on CPU.
    2. Output batches are initialized from the source frames in CPU/RAM, or temporary disk-backed storage when available RAM is insufficient.
    3. Frames are processed one-by-one using the same premultiplied-alpha blend path for every frame.

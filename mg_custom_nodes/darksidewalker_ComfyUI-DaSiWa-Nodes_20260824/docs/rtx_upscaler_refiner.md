# DaSiWa: RTX Upscaler & Refiner

This node leverages NVIDIA RTX Video SDK features to provide professional-grade image/video enhancement directly within ComfyUI. It executes up to three sequential passes in a single node, processing frame-by-frame to keep VRAM usage predictable and low.

> **Fix (v0.4.13):** `empty_cache` is now an **optional** input with a default of `False`. It had previously been a required positional input, which broke API workflows that did not pass it (fixes #24). Existing workflows are unaffected — the default preserves the original behavior.

## ⚡ Processing Pipeline
The node executes effects in this order:
1.  **Denoise (Pass 1):** Cleans up grain and compression artifacts at the source resolution.
2.  **Deblur (Pass 2):** Sharpens focus and reduces motion blur at the source resolution.
3.  **Upscale (Pass 3):** Scales the image to the target resolution using AI (VSR) or High Bitrate processing.

## 📐 Resize Types Explained

Choosing the right `resize_type` is key to getting the correct output resolution:

*   **Same Size:** The node processes the input at its original resolution. Use this if you only want to Denoise or Deblur without changing the size.
*   **Scale:** Simply multiplies the current width and height by the `scale` value. For example, a 1080p image at 2.0x scale becomes 4K.
*   **Keep Ratio:** Calculates a new resolution that hits your `megapixels` budget while preserving the exact aspect ratio of the input image. Great for maintaining the "look" while increasing quality.
*   **Preset Ratio:** Targets the `megapixels` budget but forces the image into a specific shape (like `16:9` or `9:16`) regardless of the input. Use `resize_method` to decide if the image should be cropped or letterboxed to fit.
*   **Manual:** Allows you to set the exact `width` and `height` in pixels.

## 💎 Quality Levels (Low to Ultra)

RTX Quality settings control the complexity of the AI models used:
*   **Low / Medium:** Balanced for speed. Best for real-time previews or mid-range RTX cards.
*   **High:** Standard high-quality reconstruction.
*   **Ultra (Default):** Maximum parameter count models. Provides the cleanest edges and highest detail.

## ⚠️ When Results Can Look Worse

RTX VSR is an upscaler, not a detail recovery tool for material that has already been enlarged. If the input video was previously upscaled, heavily sharpened, denoised, or re-encoded, RTX VSR may enhance those artifacts instead of creating real new detail. This can look pixelated, smeared, or over-processed.

Check these settings first when users report degraded quality:

*   **Target resolution below input:** `Keep Ratio` uses the `megapixels` value. For example, a 4K input is about 8.3 MP, so `Keep Ratio` at `2.0` MP is a downscale and will look softer.
*   **Manual size below input:** Manual `1920x1080` on a 4K source is also a downscale.
*   **Divisibility too high:** `divisible_by=8` matches RTX VSR behavior and common video sizes like 3840x2160. Use `32` only for downstream nodes that require it, because standard 2160p is not divisible by 32.
*   **Aspect changes:** `Preset Ratio` and mismatched `Manual` dimensions intentionally crop or letterbox before upscaling. Use `Scale` or `Keep Ratio` when you want to preserve the source framing.
*   **Too many cleanup passes:** Denoise and Deblur can help poor sources, but on already clean video they may remove texture before the upscale pass.

## ⚙️ Key Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **upscale** | `VSR` is best for clean AI upscaling. `High Bitrate` is specifically tuned for sources that are noisy or heavily compressed. |
| **divisible_by** | Use **8** for RTX-style image/video upscaling. Use **32** only when the next model in the workflow requires it. |
| **resize_method** | When the source and target aspect ratios don't match: `Center Crop` fills the whole target frame by cutting edges; `Letterbox` fits the whole image inside and adds black bars. |
| **device_id** | If you have multiple GPUs, set this to the index of your RTX card (usually `0`). |
| **use_mmap** | **Off** (default): disk is never used — the output is allocated lazily in memory (VRAM when it fits, otherwise RAM) and the kernel decides. **On**: opt-in disk-backed (mmap) fallback as the last tier of the VRAM -> RAM -> disk chain; it writes a multi-giB `.mmap` temp file to your temp drive for the whole run. Only enable it for very long video batches that genuinely exceed available RAM. |
| **auto_unload_models** | **On** (default): when free VRAM/RAM is insufficient for the output, unloads ComfyUI-managed models (a full `unload_all_models`, like the manual empty-cache path but more thorough) and re-checks before falling back to disk. **Off**: fall back immediately without unloading. |

## 💾 Disk-Backed (mmap) Output — `use_mmap`

`use_mmap` is **off by default**: the output is allocated lazily in memory (VRAM when it fits, otherwise RAM) and the kernel decides — matching the reference NVIDIA RTX node, so reserving a large video batch never forces the full footprint up front and no temp file is ever created. When `use_mmap` is **enabled** (opt-in, only for very long video batches that genuinely exceed available RAM), it *permits* the disk-backed (mmap) fallback; it is the last tier of the VRAM -> RAM -> disk chain and is only used when free VRAM/RAM is still insufficient after `auto_unload_models`. The file is deleted as soon as the output tensor is released.

> **Warning:** enabling `use_mmap` writes a temp file to your ComfyUI temp drive that can grow to the **full output size** (several GiB for long 4K batches; 8.99 GB was observed with Frame Interpolation) and stays on disk for the whole run. The node checks free disk space before creating the file and raises a clear error when the temp drive cannot hold output + 1 GiB reserve. On Windows, an unlinked mmap file only releases its disk space when the last handle to it is closed — while a downstream node still holds the output, the space stays charged.

## 💡 Pro-Tips

*   **Refinement First:** If your source is very low quality, enable `denoise` or `deblur` alongside `upscale`. Cleaning the image before upscaling usually yields much sharper results.
*   **VRAM Management:** This node handles the output tensor pre-allocation efficiently. However, upscaling a long video batch to 4K still requires significant system RAM. If you hit OOM, try processing smaller batches or using `Keep Ratio` with a lower `megapixels` target.
*   **Div32 Snapping:** Even in `Manual` or `Scale` modes, `divisible_by=32` can slightly adjust your dimensions. That is useful for some video VAEs, but it can avoid standard output sizes such as exact 4K.

## CPU Batch Storage

CPU output batches use the currently available RAM reported by `psutil`, not a fixed RAM cap. The node reserves 25% of total RAM on systems below 32 GiB (minimum 1 GiB), rising smoothly to an 8 GiB maximum reserve on larger systems. The reserve is used to decide whether the opt-in disk-backed (`use_mmap`) fallback is needed; when `use_mmap` is off (default), the output is allocated lazily in RAM regardless and the kernel decides. The check runs at allocation time rather than at ComfyUI startup, so it accounts for models and other workloads loaded after startup. GPU outputs retain their separate 24 GiB VRAM safety limit.

- **`use_mmap`** (off by default) *permits* the disk-backed path as the final tier of the VRAM -> RAM -> disk chain, taken only when available RAM cannot back the batch and `auto_unload_models` did not make room. **Off** (default) disables disk entirely: the output is allocated lazily in memory and a genuine OOM surfaces naturally instead of being pre-empted by a temp file.
- **`auto_unload_models`** (on by default) is the first remediation when the active tier (VRAM, or RAM on CPU) is short: it fully unloads ComfyUI-managed models, re-checks that tier, and only then drops to a lower tier.

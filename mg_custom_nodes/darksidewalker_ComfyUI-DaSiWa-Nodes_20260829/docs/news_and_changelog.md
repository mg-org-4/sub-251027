# News & Changelog

Collection-wide news and change history for the DaSiWa Custom Nodes — one place to see what changed across every node. Per-node deep dives (UI guides, wiring, options) stay in their own docs, linked from the README.

This changelog covers the last two months: **2026-06-29 → 2026-08-29**. The first commit in this window is from 2026-07-05; older history lives in the git log. All entries are listed **newest first**.

## News

- **H3 Cache compatibility & quality parity (08-29):** PDD LoRA head bank support (ComfyUI 0.34+) and per-token denoise-mask parity with Core.
- **Image Inpaint mode for the Director (08-28):** a 5-frame image-to-video pass through the native `MiniMaxH3ImageToVideo` node; the `inpaint_requested` output lets downstream sampling branch on mode.
- **Director 2.0 frozen (08-28):** the experimental v2 fork is removed from the nodepack and preserved under `frozen/`; v1 plus Image Inpaint is the supported path.
- **Seed Control node (08-26):** the Director's seed panel extracted into a standalone node with full 64-bit seeds, a Random|Fixed switch, and a NOISE-compatible output.
- **Issue forms (08-17):** structured bug-report and feature-request forms; the DaSiWa node list syncs automatically from the node registry.
- **MiniMax H3 family complete (08-16):** the collection now ships the full H3 stack — **MiniMax H3 Director** (timeline authoring, integrated 08-03), **MiniMax H3 Cache** (approximate block-stack residual cache), and **Patch Comfy Kitchen Attention** (INT8 attention model patch).
- **License: Apache 2.0 → GPL v3 (08-04).**
- **New authoring nodes (July):** Wildcard & Preset Prompt Builder, LLM / VLM Analyze (GGUF and Ollama backends), DaSiWa System Monitor, DaSiWa Torch Resize, and Enhanced Video Combine.

## Changelog

### MiniMax H3 Director (v1)

- **08-28:** **Director 2.0 frozen:** the v2 fork is removed from the nodepack and preserved under `frozen/`; Image Inpaint is documented as a v1 feature.
- **08-28:** **Image Inpaint mode** in v1: normalizer, 5-frame single-image guide, Guide-node conditioning + latent emission; `ref2va_requested` output renamed to `inpaint_requested`; request outputs now follow the mode widget; auto aspect resolves by timeline slot instead of insertion order.
- **08-26:** seed panel revamp: spinner column slimmed and aligned with the input.
- **08-19 / 08-21:** Director forked into independent v1 + v2 on 08-19; v2 gained a seed control panel, pill modals, external sampling/shift override sockets, and a socketless preview tiny-VAE combo widget (08-23); resized prompt-field heights now persist across re-renders and workflow reloads in both versions (08-21); verified dead code removed from both.
- **08-16:** Resolution/Aspect/Input-Scaling panel with external overwrite inputs; `frame_rate` FLOAT input + output (legacy `external_prompt` input dropped); paste-replace onto a selected tile; WAV `.wave` alias + RIFF duration fallback; ▶ Play crop button with a draggable preview range; Ctrl+Enter run shortcut preserved and timeline wheel forwarded to the canvas; resolution dropdowns grouped by orientation / ###p / MP with **Native (ShortEdge 768px / 2048px)** labels; `non_diegetic_music` starts empty (N/A only at assembly time); nodes re-registered under the **DaSiWa/MiniMax H3** category; canvases aligned to the H3 32-px patch grid; legacy pre-builder prompts migrated into a Simple-prompt builder state instead of being dropped; `emit()` now serializes the resolved prompt back to the `prompt` widget; fixed the double `../` in scripts/app.js + api.js imports (#28). Simple/Structured prompt-mode toggle (persisted, honored by Preview Prompt).
- **08-10:** external prompt input. (PR #21)
- **08-08:** packed stereo audio de-interleaved so stereo WAV references keep their real duration; integer PCM scaled by magnitude (a full-scale sample no longer trips the ~90 dB attenuation guard). (PR #17)
- **08-06:** fixed `KeyError 'imd'` on every REF2VA run; ref schema normalized for mixed v1/v2 workflows.
- **08-05:** prompt-builder suite: unified builder UI with mode-aware forms, REF2VA simplified to six free-text fields with v1→v2 backward-compat merge, **Insert [Shot N]** / **Prefill Labels & Summary** / **Preview Prompt** helper buttons, video thumbnail previews, single-line toolbar with Clear/Remove/?, dark-blue audio lane, and prompt-builder fields persisted across workflow reloads. Fixes: trim sliders only drag when grabbed, images drag out of locked L2VA slots, slot-capacity checks corrected, KeyError guards on `p2_shot`/`last_shot`, non-string builder values, textarea onChange receives the value instead of the Event.
- **08-04:** full refresh; helper/JS/test alignment; native generation-length alignment; VAE/CLIP naming corrected to the Comfy-Org repo; wiring diagram added and "Guide replaces native nodes" clarified in docs.
- **08-03:** initial integration of the timeline-based H3 Director and Guide nodes.
- **Earlier additions (pre-window):** embedded video audio extraction (a video can supply its own audio reference; V / A / V+A stream switch per video clip), standalone-audio trim support with waveform preview + draggable crop markers, attached soundtracks that share a video's trim window, FL2VA ↔ REF2VA mode-switch safety (incompatible references are preserved, not deleted), and hardened video duration detection with a container-level fallback.

### MiniMax H3 Cache & Patch Comfy Kitchen Attention

- **08-29:** **PDD compatibility:** the node detects the live `FinalLayer.forward` signature at patch time and passes the ComfyUI 0.34+ PDD sigma-schedule arguments, so the PDD LoRA head bank works with cache enabled. **Per-token masks:** honors `denoise_mask` / `audio_denoise_mask` exactly like Core — mixed masks run masked rows at their own strength via per-row `rows_to_mod_index` modulation; absent or uniform masks collapse to the scalar path, byte-identical to the previous behaviour. **Spectrum patch artifact:** `patches/comfyui-spectrum-minimax-h3-pdd.patch` for xmarre's ComfyUI-Spectrum-MiniMax-H3 v0.2.20, which silently degrades on the PDD signature.
- **08-16:** both nodes added: an approximate, model-scoped whole-block-stack residual cache (relative-L1 threshold sampling, 15–90% sampling window, bounded cache hits, auto/CUDA/CPU storage) and a one-input INT8-attention model patch; both are model-clone patches and chain in either order.

### Seed Control

- **08-26:** new standalone Seed Control node extracted from the Director seed panel: full 64-bit unsigned seeds, Random|Fixed segmented switch, spinner with hold-to-repeat, Last 10 seeds history, external override socket, and INT + NOISE outputs; lossless 64-bit display via decimal-string mirroring; mode, last seed, and history persist with the workflow.

### Advanced LoRA Loader (LTX-2.3)

- **08-25:** **inline value editor:** the STR, VIS, and AUDIO pills open an in-canvas editor instead of a `prompt()` dialog; the editor is pinned to its pill and tracks pan and zoom; documented.
- **08-15:** STR / VIS / A value editors no longer bounce off 0 (nullish fallback).
- **07-11:** LoRA list refreshes dynamically.

### RTX Upscaler & Refiner

- **08-23:** output batch now allocated lazily (kernel-decided, no up-front memory pressure); `use_mmap` **off by default**.
- **08-17:** **`use_mmap` disk-backed fallback** as a permission switch (VRAM → RAM → disk chain) plus default-on `auto_unload_models`.
- **08-14:** `empty_cache` made optional to restore API workflow compatibility (fixes #24, PR #26).
- **08-06:** VRAM-aware output allocation; optional `empty_cache` switch; fixed `use_mmap` swap bloat.
- **08-01:** adaptive CPU RAM reserve shared with the Watermark compositor.

### Enhanced Video Combine

- **08-22 / 08-25:** preview checkboxes (Autoplay, Mute) persist across reloads (PR #30); permanent Mute checkbox persisted with node properties.
- **08-21:** drifted combo/boolean widget values self-heal on load; audio_codec positional drift repair; MythicAlchemy v16 workflow with clean video-combine widgets.
- **08-15:** fixed audio outputs overwriting each other (counter always reset to 1).
- **08-03:** browser-compatible AV1 auto-encoding; Auto codec precedence documented (AV1 → VP9 → H.264; H.265 excluded from Auto).
- **07-22:** video frames streamed to FFmpeg instead of temp files.
- **07-21:** animated image outputs: Animated AVIF (GPU AV1 or software) and Animated WebP, with accelerated AVIF encoding.
- **07-19:** node added (IMAGE batch → video with optional AUDIO muxing and in-node preview); frame exports published to ComfyUI Assets; re-encode on queued runs; audio settings preserved in saved workflows.

### Wildcard & Preset Prompt Builder

- **08-17:** library additions: Background, Intimate Backgrounds, Weapons & Items; duplicate entries merged.
- **07-31:** segment picker interface; picker layout restored after workflow reload.
- **07-30:** node added: dual Booru / Natural-Language wildcard library, weighted bounded prompts, reproducible rerolls.

### LLM / VLM Analyze

- **07-30:** LLM cache and GGUF backends added (local GGUF via llama.cpp alongside Ollama and Hugging Face download).

### DaSiWa System Monitor

- **08-28:** Windows CIM probe now cached — no more per-second PowerShell spawns.
- **08-15:** content-sized chips (no more LITE text clipping at 4K); real disable flag + container-safe probes (`DASWA_SYSTEM_MONITOR=0`).
- **08-01:** disk telemetry + docking.
- **07-16:** node added; configurable Lite/Full display; dockable placement.

### Torch Resize

- **07-17:** node added: Lanczos batch-aware resizing on the PyTorch build ComfyUI already uses; README section rewritten as user-facing benefits.

### Resolution Scale Calculator

- **07-16:** matches the ComfyUI-native MP convention (1024²) (#4); new 1 MP resolution preset.

### Node Status Switch

- **07-31:** promoted boolean inputs now sync live.

### Metadata Image Saver

- **07-31:** skips cleanly when no image is received.

### Repository & tooling

- **08-23 / 08-26:** DaSiWa node list in the bug-report issue form synced.
- **08-19:** `.projectatlas/` build artifacts gitignored.
- **08-17:** node dropdown auto-synced from `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS`.
- **08-16:** bug-report + feature-request issue forms added; unregistered System Monitor entry dropped from the node dropdown.
- **08-04:** **license switched from Apache 2.0 to GPL v3.**
- **08-01:** node output logging centralized; modules renamed; tests folder moved behind dot-prefix.
- **07-19:** local Hermes state ignored; watermark assets + implementation plans documented.
- **07-05:** supports the new ComfyUI `validate_inputs` signature.

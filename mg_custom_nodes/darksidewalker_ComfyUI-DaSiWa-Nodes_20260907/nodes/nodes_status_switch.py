"""
DaSiWa Node Status Switch

Mutes or bypasses target nodes based on a boolean toggle.

Targets are identified by wiring any output from the node you want
to control into one of this node's target inputs.  Inputs appear
dynamically: only one empty slot is shown at a time.  When you
connect it, the next slot appears (up to 99).

The switch exposes a single BOOLEAN output (`enabled_out`) carrying
its effective `enabled` value so a chain of switches can be driven
from a single upstream toggle.  Each switch in a chain still applies
its own `trigger_on` and `action` independently.

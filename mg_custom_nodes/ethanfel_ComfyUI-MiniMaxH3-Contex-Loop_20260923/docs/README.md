# Documentation

Start with the page that matches what you are doing now. You do not need to
read the implementation references to run a normal workflow.

## New here

1. [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) — install, open an example, render,
   review, and find the result.
2. [Workflow catalog](../example_workflows/README.md) — choose the smallest
   example for your task.
3. [Node guide](NODE_REFERENCE.md) — understand the visible nodes, sockets, and
   disabled-node notation.
4. [0.5 → 0.6 major improvements](assets/minimax-h3-context-loop-0.5-to-0.6-major-improvements.png)
   — a Discord-ready visual overview of the current release.

"""Exact MiniMax H3 picture/audio timeline helpers.

H3 picture runs live on a 24 fps clock while generated audio latents live on
a 40 Hz clock. A decoded audio stream can consequently land a few
milliseconds either side of its exact frame-derived duration. Small grid
mismatches are time-conformed here instead of being repaired with silence.

"""Seam probe node: measure a join without leaving the graph.

seam_probe.py and level_step.py answer the two questions that matter at a
join, but both work on rendered files and both have to infer where the
seam is. That inference is the source of the constant ~8ms lag the CLI
probe reports: anchoring on a file's end rather than on the frame the
picture actually ends at is off by exactly the audio grid overhang, which
is a third of a step.

This node does not have to infer anything. It takes clip A as the same
latent you already pin from, and clip B before the trim, so the seam is
at a known sample and the pinned span is given rather than guessed. It
decodes A's audio and applies match_tail itself, which matters: comparing
against an untrimmed clip A would move the anchor by the overhang and
hand back a very convincing lag that is purely an artifact. Doing it
inside the node means that cannot be got wrong from the canvas.

Wire it inline: the audio VAE decode feeds this node, and this node feeds
the trim. The audio output is the input unchanged, so dropping it into an
existing chain changes nothing about the render.

    clip_a_latent      the same latent wired into Motion Context's
                       context_latent
    audio_vae          the same audio VAE
    clip_b_untrimmed   this clip's audio off the VAE decode, before trim
    trim_frames        from Motion Context, the same value the trim gets

Reported per join:

    lag_ms    how far B's reconstruction of the pinned span runs behind
              A's original. Positive means B is late.
    corr      normalised cross-correlation over the pinned span. 1.0 is
              identical shape, ~0 is unrelated. Low corr means the model
              is imitating rather than continuing.
    broadband RMS step across the cut, normalised to [0, 1].
    floor     the same for the 10th-percentile short-window RMS, which
              tracks the bed under the content. This is the one that
              catches a clip inventing its own silence.

Thresholds in the summary are the ones documented in the two scripts, not
new judgments. Numbers are always reported; the labels are a reading aid.

One limitation to know before trusting a lag figure. Cross-correlation
cannot tell a true alignment from one a whole cycle away, so on strongly
periodic content a lag larger than half a period reads as the nearest
alias instead: a 60 ms offset on material with an 18 ms period comes back
as -12.7 ms, confidently and at high correlation. Beat-driven music is
exactly this case. The tracker follows continuity between windows so a
drift cannot cycle-hop mid-span, and the first window takes the global
peak rather than assuming zero, which is what lets a uniform whole-step
offset be seen at all. But a large uniform offset on periodic content is
not something the method can resolve. Read a small lag as reliable and a
large one as "at least this much, possibly plus a whole number of
cycles".

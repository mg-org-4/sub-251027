# Resolution Tradeoffs Guide

Comprehensive guide to resolution handling in Qwen nodes, covering single-image editing, multi-image batching, and scaling strategies.

## VAE Selection Impact

Your choice of VAE affects output resolution and quality. This guide covers both options.

### Standard Wan VAE (qwen_image_vae.safetensors)
- **Scaling:** 8x (encode 1024px → output 1024px)
- **Quality:** May have "wan speckles/polka dots" artifacts
- **Use case:** Anime/stylized content, lineart, backward compatibility

### Wan2.1-VAE-upscale2x (Recommended)
- **Scaling:** 16x (encode 1024px → output 2048px via 2x decoder)
- **Quality:** Eliminates speckles, better detail preservation
- **Limitation:** Trained on real images only (may struggle with anime/lineart)
- **VRAM:** Same as standard VAE during sampling (upscaling at decode)
- **Use case:** Real photos, digital art, maximum quality
- **See:** [Wan2.1-VAE-upscale2x integration guide](wan21_vae_upscale2x_guide.md)

**Resolution examples:**
- Standard VAE: vae_max_dimension=2048 → 2048px output
- Wan2.1-upscale2x: vae_max_dimension=2048 → 4096px output
- Wan2.1-upscale2x: vae_max_dimension=1792 → 3584px output (recommended max)

The rest of this guide uses "output resolution" to account for both VAE types.

## Single Image Edit - Resolution Tradeoffs

**Small images (<512px - e.g., 384x384, 256x512):**
- `preserve_resolution`: Keeps small (384x384 → 384x384)
- `max_dimension_1024`: Upscales (384x384 → 1024x1024)
- `area_1024`: Upscales (384x384 → 1024x1024)
- Tradeoff: Small = fast/low VRAM but may lack detail for model. Upscaling adds blur but gives model more pixels to work with

**Typical images (512px-2048px - e.g., 1024x1024, 1477x2056, 1328x1328):**
- `preserve_resolution`: Keeps original (1328x1328 → 1344x1344 with 32px alignment)
- `max_dimension_1024`: Downscales larger (1328x1328 → 1024x1024)
- `area_1024`: Downscales (1328x1328 → 1024x1024)
- Tradeoff: Larger = more detail/quality but higher VRAM. Downscaling reduces VRAM but loses some detail. We don't actually know if 1024x1024 produces better results than 1328x1328 or 2048x2048 - just that it uses less VRAM

**Large images (2048px-3000px - e.g., 2560x1440, 2048x2048):**
- `preserve_resolution`: Keeps large (2560x1440 → 2560x1440)
- `max_dimension_1024`: Downscales (2560x1440 → 1024x576)
- Tradeoff: preserve gives max quality if you have VRAM. max_dimension prevents OOM but you're downscaling significantly

**4K+ images (3840x2160, 4096x4096):**
- `preserve_resolution`: Keeps huge (3840x2176 with alignment)
- `max_dimension_1024`: Downscales heavily (3840x2160 → 1024x576)
- Tradeoff: preserve will likely OOM on most GPUs. max_dimension is basically required unless you have 48GB+ VRAM

**Odd dimensions (1023x1025, 1477x2056):**
- All modes apply 32px alignment (1023x1025 → 1024x1024, 1477x2056 → 1472x2048)
- Minor cropping, usually imperceptible
- Tradeoff: None really, alignment is required for VAE

## Multi-Image Edit - Resolution Tradeoffs

**Identical dimensions (1024x1024, 1024x1024, 1024x1024):**
- All strategies work identically
- Zero aspect distortion
- Most predictable, cleanest results
- Tradeoff: You need to pre-process images to match

**Same aspect ratio (512x768, 1024x1536, 768x512 - all 2:3):**
- `max_dimensions` scales to largest (1024x1536)
- Minimal distortion since aspect matches
- Clean batching
- Tradeoff: Still need to scale smaller images up (quality loss on upscale)

**Similar aspect ratios (portrait group: 3:4, 2:3, 9:16):**
- `max_dimensions`: Small adjustments, mostly manageable
- Some distortion but usually acceptable
- Tradeoff: Subjects may appear slightly stretched/squashed depending on how different the ratios are

**Mixed portrait + landscape (1024x768 + 768x1024):**
- `max_dimensions`: Forces one orientation to match the other
- Significant distortion inevitable
- `first_image`: Hero image preserved, others distorted heavily
- Tradeoff: You're basically choosing which images you're OK with distorting. Works but expect visible artifacts on the non-dominant orientation

**Extreme differences (512x512 + 3840x2160):**
- `max_dimensions`: Huge upscale on small image (quality loss)
- `first_image`: Depends on order - either massive downscale or massive upscale
- Tradeoff: One image will suffer quality loss regardless. Better to pre-scale before batching

**Very large gaps (512x512 + 1024x1024 + 2048x2048):**
- `max_dimensions`: Scales all to 2048x2048 (512 gets 4x upscale)
- Small images get blurry, large images OK
- Tradeoff: VRAM usage based on largest image, quality loss on smallest

## Scaling Mode Details

### preserve_resolution (default, recommended)
- Keeps original dimensions with 32px alignment
- No zoom-out effect, subjects stay full-size
- Best quality output, minimal cropping
- Works perfectly for typical image sizes (512px-2048px)
- May use significant VRAM with very large images (4K+)

### max_dimension_1024 (for 4K/large images)
- Scales largest side to 1024px
- Reduces VRAM usage significantly on large images
- Balanced quality vs performance tradeoff
- Prevents OOM errors on 4K images
- Some zoom-out effect on images larger than 1024px

### area_1024 (legacy, not recommended)
- Scales to ~1024x1024 area (~1 megapixel)
- Consistent output size
- Aggressive zoom-out on large images (major quality loss)
- Upscales small images unnecessarily (wastes quality)
- Poor behavior across different input sizes

### no_scaling (batch node only)
- Pass images through as-is
- Only applies 32px alignment
- Useful when you want full control over dimensions
- Recommended when using with advanced encoder (let it handle scaling)

## QwenImageBatch Parameters

**scaling_mode**: How to calculate target resolution for each image
- `preserve_resolution` (default): Keeps original size (32px aligned) - best quality basically
- `max_dimension_1024`: Scales largest side to 1024px - reduces VRAM
- `area_1024`: Scales to ~1024x1024 area - legacy behavior
- `no_scaling`: Pass through as-is

**batch_strategy**: How to handle different aspect ratios when batching
- `max_dimensions` (default): Uses max width/height across all images - minimal distortion ideally but still expect it as you add more images, though YMMV depending on aspect ratio diffs across inputs
- `first_image`: Forces all images to match first image's dimensions - likely to distort more but lets you control which one you care about, which theoretically should be complementary with the advanced encoder node for letting you weight as well. Basically the hero image wins.

## Example Scenarios

### 3 images all with same aspect ratios (1024x1024, 1024x1024, 1024x1024):
- All strategies work identically
- No aspect distortion regardless of choice

### Different aspect ratios (1024x1024, 1024x1024, 1328x1024):
- `max_dimensions`: Scales all to 1344x1024 (minimal distortion, but YMMV based on image resolution diffs across input images, image 3 stays around the same)
- `first_image`: Scales all to 1024x1024 (more distortion on image 3)

## When to Use What

**Default to `max_dimensions`**: Likely to get best quality typically
- Mixed aspect ratios but you want batching
- Best option for minimizing aspect distortion if that's important for your use case
- Works with all encoder nodes

**Use `first_image`**:
- You want your hero/main image to dictate all dimensions
- Acceptable if other images get slightly distorted
- Complementary with advanced node hero modes and weights but not necessary to use unless you want more control

**Single image editing**: Don't use QwenImageBatch - connect LoadImage directly to encoder's `edit_image` input. Batch node is only needed for 2+ images.

## Technical Notes

- Vision encoder always scales to 384x384 target area (unchangeable)
- VAE encoder respects scaling_mode setting
- 32px alignment required throughout pipeline for VAE compatibility
- Batch node marks images with metadata (`qwen_pre_scaled=True`) to prevent double-scaling in encoders
- Advanced encoder can apply additional resolution weighting on top of batch scaling

## Wan2.1-VAE-upscale2x Optimization

If using the Wan2.1-VAE-upscale2x (2x decoder upscaling), adjust your `vae_max_dimension` settings for optimal quality/VRAM balance.

### Recommended vae_max_dimension Values

**Standard Wan VAE (current default: 2048):**
- Encodes at 2048px → Outputs at 2048px
- Straightforward 1:1 relationship

**Wan2.1-VAE-upscale2x (recommended: 1792):**
- Encodes at 1792px → Outputs at 3584px (2x upscaling in decoder)
- Hits model's maximum resolution (3584px = 16,384 tokens)
- Same quality as encoding at 3584px with standard VAE, but uses half the VRAM

### VRAM-Based Recommendations

| VRAM Tier | vae_max_dimension | Encode Size | Output Size (2x) | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 8GB | 1024 | 1024×1024 | 2048×2048 | Baseline, safe |
| 10GB | 1280 | 1280×1280 | 2560×2560 | High quality |
| 12GB | 1536 | 1536×1536 | 3072×3072 | Very high quality |
| 12GB+ | **1792** | 1792×1792 | **3584×3584** | **Recommended max** |
| 16GB+ | 2048 | 2048×2048 | 4096×4096 | Experimental |

### Multi-Image Adjustments

**With Wan2.1-upscale2x, lower encode sizes still give great outputs:**

**2-3 images:**
- vae_max_dimension: 1536 → 3072px output per image
- Still very high quality, better VRAM safety

**4+ images:**
- vae_max_dimension: 1280 → 2560px output per image
- Prevents OOM errors while maintaining quality

**Example comparison:**
```
Standard VAE (3 images at 2048px):
  - Encode: 3 × 2048px = 6144px total processing
  - Output: 3 × 2048px images
  - High VRAM usage

Wan2.1-upscale2x (3 images at 1536px):
  - Encode: 3 × 1536px = 4608px total processing (28% less)
  - Output: 3 × 3072px images (50% larger than standard!)
  - Lower VRAM, higher output resolution
```

### Advanced Encoder with 2x VAE

Use lower base dimensions with hero/reference weighting:

```python
vae_max_dimension: 1536  # Base for all images
resolution_mode: "hero_first"
hero_weight: 1.17        # 1536 × 1.17 ≈ 1792 → 3584px output
reference_weight: 0.67   # 1536 × 0.67 ≈ 1024 → 2048px output
```

**Result:**
- Hero image: 3584×3584 output (model maximum)
- References: 2048×2048 output (sufficient for context)
- Optimal VRAM/quality balance

### Why Lower Encode Sizes Work Better with 2x VAE

**Problem with high encode + standard VAE:**
- Encoding 3584×3584 uses massive VRAM
- Only outputs 3584×3584 (same as encode)
- Model maximum anyway, no benefit beyond this

**Solution with lower encode + 2x VAE:**
- Encoding 1792×1792 uses half the VRAM
- Outputs 3584×3584 (same final resolution!)
- Latent degradation training ensures quality
- Decoder upscaling is high quality (pixel shuffle, not interpolation)

### Vision Encoder Note

Regardless of VAE choice or `vae_max_dimension` setting:
- Vision encoder ALWAYS processes at 384×384 area
- This is for semantic understanding, not pixel detail
- The VAE path handles all pixel-level resolution
- Both paths see same aspect ratio, different resolutions

# Z-Image Character Generation Guide

Using structured character profiles with multi-turn conversations to maintain consistency while making precise edits.

**New to Z-Image nodes?** Start with [z_image_intro.md](z_image_intro.md) for the basics.

**NOTE: THIS DOES NOT GENERATE ANYTHING, you must provide that - this only provides a framework for using it in a different way**

## Multi-Turn Character Editing

The most powerful use of our nodes is maintaining character consistency across edits. By defining a detailed character in the first turn, then making targeted modifications in subsequent turns, you can make precise changes while preserving the rest.

### Full Example: Walter Finch

**ZImageTextEncoder (First Turn):**
```
system_prompt: "Generate an image in classic American comic book style. Bold outlines, flat colors with halftone shading."

user_prompt: |
  # Character Profile: Walter Finch (Wally)

  ## Core Identity
  - **Name:** Walter Finch (Nickname: Wally)
  - **Gender:** Male
  - **Age:** 72
  - **Ethnicity:** Caucasian (British descent)
  - **Skin Tone:** Fair, warm sun-kissed glow on cheeks and nose

  ## Head & Face
  - **Face Shape:** Oval, prominent jawline, receding hairline
  - **Eye Color:** Ice-blue with subtle gold flecks around the iris
  - **Hair:** Pure white, side-parted, full beard and mustache
  - **Glasses:** Thin, gold-rimmed reading glasses
  - **Expression:** Warm, gentle smile with a twinkle in his eye

  ## Attire
  - Light gray and blue checkered button-down shirt
  - Dark grey wool trousers
  - Brown leather loafers

  ## Props
  - Pale lavender ceramic mug of coffee
  - Gold pocket watch chain visible in breast pocket

add_think_block: true
thinking_content: "Hmm lets make his beard a little red and keep everything else the same."
assistant_content: "Sure, here's a photo of Wally with his red and white beard."
```

**ZImageTurnBuilder (Second Turn):**
```
previous: [from encoder's conversation output]
clip: [from CLIPLoader - enables direct conditioning output]

user_prompt: "Let's put a cute baby flying sloth above him too"
thinking_content: "Hm, let's make it a black sloth, flying above the man's head."
is_final: true
```

### Why This Works

The full conversation is encoded together:
```
<|im_start|>system
Generate an image in classic American comic book style...<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Character Profile: Walter Finch (Wally)
[full character sheet]<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>Hmm lets make his beard a little red...</think>
Sure, here's a photo of Wally with his red and white beard.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's put a cute baby flying sloth above him too<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>Hm, let's make it a black sloth, flying above the man's head.</think>

```

The model sees the original detailed definition AND all the subsequent modifications in context.

### Tips for Multi-Turn Character Work

1. **Be explicit about what stays**: In thinking blocks, note what should be preserved
2. **Make one change per turn**: Don't overload modifications
3. **Use thinking to guide changes**: "Keep the glasses and shirt, only change the beard"
4. **Chain carefully**: Each turn builds on previous ones
5. **Watch token length**: Detailed character sheets + multiple turns can exceed 512 tokens. Reference implementations truncate at 512, though this appears to be a choice rather than a hard limit. If you see artifacts with very long conversations, try simplifying.

## Using LLMs to Generate Prompts

You can use any LLM to help generate detailed character profiles. However, there's a significant technical advantage to using **Qwen3 family models** (Qwen3-0.5B through Qwen3-235B) when generating prompts for Z-Image.

### Why Qwen3 Models Are Optimal

Z-Image uses Qwen3-4B as its text encoder. All models in the Qwen3 family share the **same tokenizer and vocabulary**. This creates a unique advantage.

#### The Problem: Cross-Family "Translation"

When you use a different model family (Llama, GPT, Claude, etc.) to generate a prompt:

1. **Source Generation**: The LLM generates text using its own tokenizer
2. **Re-tokenization**: Z-Image's encoder (Qwen3-4B) re-encodes that text into its own token IDs
3. **Information Loss**: The subtle semantic nuances intended by the source model are lost in translation

Different tokenizers break text into different subword units. The same sentence becomes different sequences of integers. The receiving model gets a "translated" version of the concept, not the original intent.

#### The Solution: Direct Token Transfer

When you use a Qwen3 model to generate the prompt:

1. **Source Generation**: Qwen3 (any size) generates text as a sequence of **Qwen3 Token IDs**
2. **Direct Transfer**: These exact Token IDs pass directly to Z-Image's encoder (Qwen3-4B)
3. **High-Fidelity Priming**: The encoder interprets the incoming tokens with near-perfect fidelity

Because both models share the same vocabulary, the exact integer ID representing each subword is identical. You're not transferring text - you're transferring a pre-computed semantic state.

#### The Thinking Block Advantage

This is especially powerful with `<think>` blocks. When a larger Qwen3 model (like Qwen3-72B or Qwen3-235B) generates thinking content:

```
<think>
The character should have weathered skin with visible sun damage around the eyes.
The lighting should be warm side-light from the left, suggesting late afternoon.
Expression is contemplative but not sad - slight smile, distant gaze.
</think>
```

These tokens prime Z-Image's encoder to a configuration that directly reflects the larger model's reasoning. The 4B encoder essentially receives "art direction" from a much more capable model, in a format it natively understands.

### Practical Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Quick prompts | Any LLM is fine |
| Detailed character work | Prefer Qwen3 family |
| Complex thinking blocks | Strongly prefer Qwen3-72B+ |
| Maximum fidelity | Qwen3-235B-A22B (if available) |

### Example: Using Qwen3 for Prompt Generation

**System prompt for the generating LLM:**

```
You are a visual prompt engineer for a text-to-image model.

Your task is to generate detailed, visually-specific character descriptions.
Focus on concrete visual details - colors, textures, lighting, poses.
Avoid abstract concepts like "beautiful" or "mysterious".

When asked about a character:
1. First, think through the visual elements in a <think> block
2. Then provide a structured character profile

Format your thinking to include:
- Key distinguishing features
- Lighting and atmosphere decisions
- Composition notes
- What to emphasize vs de-emphasize

The output will be used directly as a prompt, so be specific and visual.
```

**User request:**
```
Create a character profile for a 72-year-old British gentleman named Walter,
in American comic book style.
```

**Qwen3 output (use this directly in ZImageTextEncoder):**

```
<think>
Key features: elderly but dignified, British character actor type.
Face: oval with prominent jawline, weathered but kind.
Eyes should be distinctive - ice blue with warmth, gold-rimmed glasses.
Hair: pure white, well-groomed beard, side-parted hair.
Attire: classic intellectual - checkered shirt, wool trousers, leather loafers.
Props: coffee mug (lavender ceramic), pocket watch chain - these add character.
Style: bold comic outlines, flat colors, halftone shading.
Expression: warm smile, twinkle in eye - approachable grandfather type.
Lighting: even comic-style, minimal shadows, clear features.
</think>

# Character Profile: Walter Finch (Wally)
[... structured profile follows ...]
```

The entire output - including the `<think>` block - can be pasted directly into `user_prompt` with `add_think_block: true`. The thinking content goes into `thinking_content`, and the model receives the full semantic context.

### Using Other LLMs

Other LLMs (Claude, GPT, Llama, etc.) can absolutely generate good prompts. The structured formats in this guide work with any source. You'll just miss the token-level fidelity advantage.

If using a non-Qwen LLM:
- Focus on the visual vocabulary sections below
- Use clear, concrete language
- The prompt quality matters more than the source model for most use cases

The Qwen3 advantage is most noticeable for complex, nuanced character work where subtle semantic details matter.

## Core Principle

The model needs **visual details**, not story. Every word should describe something you can see.

| Good (Visual) | Bad (Abstract) |
|---------------|----------------|
| deep-set eyes with dark circles | tired expression |
| worn brown leather jacket, cracked at elbows | old jacket |
| sharp cheekbones, hollow cheeks | thin face |
| warm amber side-light from left | good lighting |

---

## Format Options

### Option 1: Prose (Most Natural)

Natural sentences flow well. The model reads this like a description.

```
A woman in her late 20s with sharp East Asian features. Black hair cut asymmetrically -
short on the right, falling past her jaw on the left. Pale skin with a slight blue
undertone, dark circles under her eyes. She wears a oversized grey hoodie, hood down,
with a faded band logo barely visible. Expression is guarded but curious, mouth slightly
open as if about to speak. Soft diffused light from above, cool color temperature.
Background is out of focus warm tones suggesting an interior space.
```

### Option 2: Sectioned Prose (Organized but Natural)

Headers organize without fragmenting.

```
FACE: Sharp East Asian features, late 20s. Pale skin with blue undertone, visible
dark circles. High cheekbones, small nose, full lips slightly parted.

HAIR: Black, asymmetrical cut. Cropped close on right side, falls to jaw on left.
Straight, slightly greasy texture.

EXPRESSION: Guarded curiosity. Eyes alert and watchful, brows slightly raised.
Mouth open as if about to speak.

CLOTHING: Oversized grey hoodie, hood down. Fabric is soft cotton, well-worn.
Faded band logo on chest, text illegible.

LIGHTING: Soft diffused overhead light, cool temperature. Subtle warm fill
from below suggesting screen glow.
```

### Option 3: Compact List (Quick Reference)

Dense but specific. Good for simpler characters.

```
- late 20s woman, sharp East Asian features
- asymmetric black hair: short right, jaw-length left
- pale skin, blue undertone, dark circles
- oversized grey hoodie, faded logo, hood down
- guarded expression, alert eyes, parted lips
- cool overhead light, warm fill from below
```

| "beautiful" | Subjective, no visual info | Describe specific features |
| "mysterious expression" | Abstract | "narrowed eyes, slight frown, closed lips" |
| "nice clothes" | Vague | "navy wool peacoat, brass buttons" |
| "good lighting" | Meaningless | "soft side light from left, warm tone" |
| Long backstory | Model can't visualize story | Cut to visual details only |
| "like [celebrity]" | Inconsistent results | Describe actual features |

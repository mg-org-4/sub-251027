# ComfyUI-RequestNodes

[中文版本](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

ComfyUI-RequestNodes is a custom node plugin for ComfyUI that provides functionality for sending HTTP requests and related utilities. Currently, it includes the following nodes:

*   **Get Request Node**: Sends GET requests and retrieves responses.
*   **Post Request Node**: Sends POST requests and retrieves responses.
*   **Form Post Request Node**: Sends POST requests in `multipart/form-data` format, supporting file (image) uploads.
*   **Rest Api Node**: A versatile node for sending various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS) with retry settings.
*   **Image to Base64 Node**: Converts an image to a Base64 encoded string.
*   **Image to Blob Node**: Converts an image to a Blob (Binary Large Object).
*   **Key/Value Node**: Creates key/value pairs for building request parameters, headers, or other dictionary-like structures.
*   **Chain Image Node**: Uploads an image and adds it to an image batch, allowing for chaining to build a batch from multiple images.
*   **String Replace Node**: Replaces placeholders in a string with provided values.
*   **Retry Settings Node**: Creates retry setting configurations for the Rest Api Node.

    *   **Example**:

    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `key` (Dropdown, required): The retry setting key (`max_retry`, `retry_interval`, `retry_until_status_code`, `retry_until_not_status_code`).
        *   `value` (INT, required): The integer value for the retry setting.
        *   `RETRY_SETTING` (RETRY_SETTING, optional): Connect output from other Retry Settings Nodes to merge settings.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `RETRY_SETTING` (RETRY_SETTING): A dictionary containing the retry setting(s).

    **Retry Logic Explanation:**

    The `Retry Settings Node` allows you to configure automatic retries for the `Rest Api Node` when specific conditions are met. The retry logic works as follows:

    *   **`max_retry`**: Defines the maximum number of times to retry the request after the initial attempt fails. For example, `max_retry: 3` means a total of 1 (initial) + 3 (retries) = 4 attempts. If set to 0 *and* specific status code conditions are defined, it will retry indefinitely. If no retry settings are provided, the default is no retries. If the `RETRY_SETTING` input is connected but `max_retry` is not explicitly set, it defaults to 3 retries.
    *   **`retry_interval`**: Specifies the delay in milliseconds between retry attempts (default is 1000ms).
    *   **`retry_until_status_code`**: The node will keep retrying *as long as* the HTTP status code received is *not* equal to this value (and `max_retry` limit is not reached). Useful for waiting for a specific success code (e.g., 200).
    *   **`retry_until_not_status_code`**: The node will keep retrying *as long as* the HTTP status code received *is* equal to this value (and `max_retry` limit is not reached). Useful for retrying on specific temporary error codes (e.g., retrying while status is 202 Accepted).
    *   **Default Retry Condition (Non-2xx):** If `max_retry` is set (or defaults to 3) but *neither* `retry_until_status_code` nor `retry_until_not_status_code` are specified, the node will retry *only if* the status code is *not* in the 200-299 range (i.e., a non-successful response).
    *   **Exceptions:** Any network or request exception will also trigger a retry attempt, respecting the `max_retry` limit and `retry_interval`.
    *   **Priority:** If both `retry_until_status_code` and `retry_until_not_status_code` are set, both conditions must be met (or not met, respectively) to stop retrying based on status code. The default non-2xx condition is only checked if specific status code conditions are *not* set.

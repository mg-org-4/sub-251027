# ComfyUI KIE API Nodes

## Project overview
A set of ComfyUI custom nodes that connect to the Kie.ai API for image and video generation workflows.

## Why this exists
ComfyUI users often need consistent, API-backed nodes that map directly to model capabilities and work reliably in production workflows. This pack focuses on clear inputs, predictable outputs, and practical integration.

### Supporting Development

This project is built for the ComfyUI community and maintained in personal time.

If you find the nodes useful and are already planning to use **Kie.ai**, using the link below is one way to support continued development and improvements. There is no obligation, and everything works the same regardless.

👉 [https://kie.ai](https://kie.ai?ref=e7565cf24a7fad4586341a87eaf21e42)

## What’s included
- Image generation nodes
- Image-to-video and text-to-video nodes
- Utility helpers for grid slicing and prompt parsing

Node-specific documentation is available in `web/docs`.

## API Key Setup

To use these nodes, you must provide your own Kie.ai API key.

**Steps:**
- Open `config/kie_key.example.txt`
- Paste your Kie.ai API key into the file
- Save the file as `kie_key.txt` in the same `config/` directory

**Important:**  
Do **NOT** share your API key or commit it to version control.

## Included Example Workflows

This repository includes several example workflows intended as both a test bed and a reference for how these nodes can be used together.

---

### 1) Node Pack Test & Reference Workflow
**Kie-AI-Nodes.json**

This workflow includes **all nodes in this pack**, each accompanied by inline notes explaining what the node does and how to use it.

**Recommended first step:**  
Always start by running the **Credits / Account Check** node. This confirms:
- Your Kie.ai API key is installed correctly
- Your account has available credits
- The API is reachable

Once credits are confirmed, you can unmute individual node groups and test them incrementally. This workflow is designed to be a safe environment for validation, learning, and debugging before building custom graphs.

---

### 2) Nano Banana Pro Grid Workflow (Advanced Example)
**Kie-AI-Banana-Pro-Grid.json**

This workflow demonstrates a more advanced use case built around **Nano Banana Pro** and grid-based image generation.

**Overview:**
- An optional *face reference image* and a required *source image* are provided
- A language model analyzes the inputs and generates structured prompts
- These prompts are used to generate a **2×2 or 3×3 grid of images**
- The resulting grid is then sliced into individual images using the Grid Slice node

**About the LLM step:**
- This workflow uses an OpenAI Chat LLM node provided by ComfyUI (not part of this node pack)
- This step incurs its own API cost
- You are free to replace this LLM with any compatible model or remove it entirely

**Why this workflow exists:**
This pattern is useful for:
- Generating multiple prompt variations from a single concept
- Creating image sets for downstream video generation
- Breaking large composite images into reusable individual assets

---

These workflows are meant as **examples**, not strict requirements.  
Feel free to adapt, simplify, or remix them to fit your own pipelines.

---

### 3) Nano Banana Pro + Nano Banana 2 Comparison Workflow
**KIE-AI-Banana-Pro-Banana-Pro.json**

This workflow is focused on direct comparison between **Nano Banana Pro** and **Nano Banana 2** in a single graph.

**Overview:**
- Uses matching prompt structure to compare output behavior side by side
- Includes Nano Banana 2 runs with optional web-search grounding
- Supports reference-image driven comparisons for iterative testing

This is useful for quickly evaluating model preference by prompt type, fidelity, and cost/performance tradeoffs.

---

### 4) Kling 3.0 Motion-Control Workflow
**Kie AI - Kling 3.0 Motion.json**

This workflow is focused on **Kling 3.0 Motion-Control** using:
- one reference image
- one motion-driver video
- an optional prompt for extra control

**Overview:**
- Transfers motion from a driver video onto the subject from a still image
- Exposes Kling 3.0 motion settings such as `character_orientation` and resolution mode
- Useful for directed image-to-video tests where identity comes from the image and movement comes from the video

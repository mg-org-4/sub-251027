(ComfyUI workflow included)

Create a OutputList by separating the string in the textfield.
`value` and `index` use(s) `is_output_list=True` (indicated by the symbol `𝌠`) and will be processed sequentially by corresponding nodes.

### Inputs

| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| `separator`	| `STRING`	| The string to split the textfield values by.	|
| `values`	| `STRING`	| The string which will be separated. Note that the string is trimmed of trailing newlines before splitting, and each item is again trimmed.	|

## OutputLists Combinations

![OutputLists Combinations](CombineOutputLists/CombineOutputLists.png)

(ComfyUI workflow included)

Takes up to 4 OutputLists and generates every combination of them.

Example: `[1, 2, 3] x ["A", "B"] = [(1, "A"), (1, "B"), (2, "A"), (2, "B"), (3, "A"), (3, "B")]`

`unzip_a` .. `unzip_d` use(s) `is_output_list=True` (indicated by the symbol `𝌠`) and will be processed sequentially by corresponding nodes.

All lists are optional and empty lists will be ignored.

Technically it computes *the Cartesian product* and outputs each combination splitted up into their elements (`unzip`), whereas empty lists will be replaced with units of `None` and they will emit `None` on the respective output.

Example: `[1, 2] x [] x ["A", "B"] x [] = [(1, None, "A", None), (1, None, "B", None), (2, None, "A", None), (2, None, "B", None)]`

Alternative usage: If you connect one list to a unit value it essentially works as a on-signal node (a.k.a execution order enforcer).

# ComfyUI-ProportionChanger

This custom node is created by decomposing and porting the WanVideo UniAnimate DWPose Detector node from [kijai's ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper). The key difference is that instead of using image inputs, it now accepts DWPose KeyPoint data as input, enabling manipulation of body types that cannot be estimated by DWPose alone.

Additionally, the Openpose Editor node from [toyxyz/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor](https://github.com/toyxyz/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor) has been similarly decomposed and ported, enabling fine-tuning of individual parts.

## Features

### Node Overview
- **ProportionChanger DWPose Detector**: Detects DWPose KeyPoints from images
- **ProportionChanger Reference**: Transforms proportions to reference poses
- **ProportionChanger DWPose Render**: Converts KeyPoints to images
- **ProportionChanger Params**: Adjusts parameters for individual KeyPoint parts
- **ProportionChanger Interpolator**: Interpolates KeyPoint videos with in-betweening
- **PoseData to pose_keypoint**: Converts WanAnimate `POSEDATA` into `POSE_KEYPOINT`
- **pose_keypoint resize**: Resizes `POSE_KEYPOINT` to a target size (pads then scales to avoid stretching when aspect differs)
- **pose_keypoint input**: Converts JSON text to KeyPoints
- **pose_keypoint preview**: Converts KeyPoints to JSON

## Installation
### Install via ComfyUI Manager
1. Search for "ComfyUI-ProportionChanger" in ComfyUI Manager's Custom Nodes Manager and install

2. Restart ComfyUI

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `custom_nodes` folder:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/grmchn/ComfyUI-ProportionChanger.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd ComfyUI-ProportionChanger
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

Please refer to example_workflows.

![proportion_changer_basic2](docs/images/example_basic2.png)

### Converting WanAnimate POSEDATA
- Use WanAnimatePreprocess "Pose and Face Detection" to produce `POSEDATA`
- Feed `POSEDATA`, `width`, and `height` into **PoseData to pose_keypoint**
- Connect the resulting `pose_keypoint` to ProportionChanger Reference / Render nodes
- Example workflow: `example_workflows/proportion_changer_pose_data_to_pose_keypoint.json`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model Loading Errors**: Models should be automatically downloaded from HuggingFace. Please ensure DWPose models are in the correct directory.
2. **Incorrect body proportions after transformation with reference image**: The `pose_keypoint` and `reference_pose_keypoint` aspect ratios (canvas width/height) may not match. **ProportionChanger Reference** has `auto_resize_reference` (default ON) to automatically align the reference to the pose canvas size. If needed, use **pose_keypoint resize** to explicitly align `width`/`height`. Fine-tune individual body parts using the "ProportionChanger Params" node.
3. **Nothing displays after transformation with reference image**: The reference image's pose estimation by DWPose has failed. Use OpenposeEditor or similar tools to input parameter values manually.

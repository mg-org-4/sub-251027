# Testing in FastVideo

This guide explains how to add and run tests in FastVideo. The testing suite is divided into several categories to ensure correctness across components, training workflows, and inference quality.

## Test Types

* **Unit Tests**: Located in `fastvideo/tests/dataset`, `fastvideo/tests/entrypoints`, and `fastvideo/tests/workflow`. These test individual functions and classes.
* **Component Tests**: Located in `fastvideo/tests/encoders`, `fastvideo/tests/transformers`, and `fastvideo/tests/vaes`. These verify the loading and basic functionality of model components.
* **SSIM Tests**: Located in `fastvideo/tests/ssim`. These are regression tests that compare generated videos against reference videos using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to detect quality degradation.
* **Training Tests**: Located in `fastvideo/tests/training`. These validate training loops, loss calculations, and specific training techniques like LoRA, Distillation, and VSA.
* **Inference Tests**: Located in `fastvideo/tests/inference`. These test specialized inference pipelines and optimizations (e.g., VSA, V-MoBA).

For now, we will focus on **SSIM Tests**.

## SSIM Tests

SSIM tests are located in `fastvideo/tests/ssim`. These tests generate videos using specific models and parameters, and compare them against reference videos to ensure that changes in the codebase do not degrade generation quality or alter the output unexpectedly.

!!! note
    If you are adding an SSIM test, this serves as a safeguard. Any future code changes that break or cause errors with the specific arguments and configurations you defined will trigger a failure. Therefore, it is important to include multiple settings and arguments that cover the core features of your new pipeline to ensure robust regression testing.

```

### Adding a New SSIM Test

To add a new SSIM test, follow these steps:

1. **Create or Update a Test File**: Prefer model-specific files (for example `test_wan_t2v_similarity.py`) and create a new one when testing a distinct model or pipeline.

2. **Define Model Parameters**: Define the configuration for the model you want to test. This includes model path, dimensions, inference steps, and other generation parameters. **Note:** Consider using lower `num_inference_steps` or reduced resolution (e.g., 480p instead of 720p) to keep test execution time reasonable, provided it doesn't compromise the test's ability to detect regression.

   ```python
   MY_MODEL_PARAMS = {
       "num_gpus": 1,
       "model_path": "organization/model-name",
       "height": 480,
       "width": 832,
       "num_frames": 45,
       "num_inference_steps": 20,
       # ... other parameters
   }
   ```

3. **Implement the Test Function**:
   * Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run the test with different prompts, backends, and models.
   * Set the attention backend environment variable.
   * Initialize the `VideoGenerator`.
   * Generate the video.
   * Compare the generated video with the reference video using `compute_video_ssim_torchvision`.

   Example structure:

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("prompt", TEST_PROMPTS)
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("ATTENTION_BACKEND", ["FLASH_ATTN"])
   def test_my_model_similarity(prompt, ATTENTION_BACKEND):
       # Setup output directories
       # ...

       # Initialize Generator
       generator = VideoGenerator.from_pretrained(...)
       generator.generate_video(prompt, ...)

       # Compare with Reference
       ssim_values = compute_video_ssim_torchvision(
           reference_path, generated_path, use_ms_ssim=True
       )
       assert ssim_values[0] >= 0.98  # Threshold
   ```

4. **Reference Videos**:
   * When running the test for the first time (or when updating the reference), the test will fail because the reference video is missing. The generated video will be saved in `fastvideo/tests/ssim/generated_videos/<quality-tier>/<GPU>_reference_videos`.
   * Inspect the generated video to ensure it meets quality expectations.
   * Move the generated video to the appropriate quality/GPU reference folder:
     `fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos/<quality-tier>/<GPU>_reference_videos/<Model>/<Backend>/`.
   * You can use the helper CLI to copy generated videos into a reference folder:
     `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py copy-local --quality-tier default --reference-dir fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos/default/L40S_reference_videos`
   * Upload/download can target both quality tiers and specific GPU folders:
     `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py upload --quality-tier all`
     `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py download --quality-tier full_quality --device-folder H200_reference_videos`

### Running Tests Locally

To run the SSIM tests locally:

```bash
pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/ -vs
```

Ensure you have the necessary GPUs available as defined in your test parameters.

## CI Integration

FastVideo uses [Modal](https://modal.com/) for running tests in a CI environment. The
workflow scripts are located in `fastvideo/tests/modal/`.

### Buildkite Pipeline

Tests are orchestrated by Buildkite (`.buildkite/pipeline.yml`) and executed on Modal GPU
instances. The pipeline runs in two modes:

**Fastcheck** — runs on every PR push, path-filtered. Only tests for the components you
changed are triggered. Tests run in parallel.

**Full Suite** — runs when a PR enters the Merge Queue (or when triggered manually via
`/test full`). Covers SSIM regression, training, distillation, inference, and performance.

### `pr_test.py`

The main entry point for CI tests is `fastvideo/tests/modal/pr_test.py`. This script defines
Modal functions that execute the pytest suites on specific hardware (e.g., L40S, H100).

### Updating Modal Configuration

If you add a new test that requires:

* **Different GPU Hardware**: You may need to change the `@app.function(gpu=...)` decorator.
* **Longer Execution Time**: Increase the `timeout` parameter.
* **New Environment Variables/Secrets**: Add them to `secrets=[...]` or the image
  environment. For example, if your model is gated on Hugging Face, ensure `HF_API_KEY`
  is passed.

For SSIM tests, use `fastvideo/tests/modal/ssim_test.py`:

```bash
python -m modal run fastvideo/tests/modal/ssim_test.py::run_ssim_tests
```

Target specific SSIM files/models:

```bash
python -m modal run fastvideo/tests/modal/ssim_test.py::run_ssim_tests \
  --test-files test_wan_t2v_similarity.py \
  --model-ids Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
```

If HF token env vars are not set (`HF_API_KEY` / `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` /
`HF_TOKEN`), the local entrypoint fails fast. To export raw `generated_videos`
from Modal to the shared volume:

```bash
python -m modal run fastvideo/tests/modal/ssim_test.py::run_ssim_tests \
  --sync-generated-to-volume
```

The raw export path is quality-tiered:

* default params: `ssim_generated_videos/default/<subdir>/generated_videos`
* full-quality params: `ssim_generated_videos/full_quality/<subdir>/generated_videos`

The printed `modal volume get` command also downloads into a quality-specific
local directory under `./generated_videos_modal/<quality-tier>`.

To turn downloaded Modal outputs into local reference videos, use the matching
quality tier with `copy-local`, for example:

```bash
python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py copy-local \
  --quality-tier full_quality \
  --generated-dir ./generated_videos_modal/full_quality/L40S_reference_videos \
  --device-folder L40S_reference_videos
```

### Workflow Scripts

The shell script that triggers tests in CI is `.buildkite/scripts/pr_test.sh`. If you add
a new test category (e.g., a new folder outside of `ssim`), you will need to:

1. Add a new function in `fastvideo/tests/modal/pr_test.py`.
2. Add a new case in `.buildkite/scripts/pr_test.sh` to handle the new test type.

!!! note
    If you are a maintainer, update the workflow script in Buildkite after merging. Otherwise,
    ask a maintainer for help.

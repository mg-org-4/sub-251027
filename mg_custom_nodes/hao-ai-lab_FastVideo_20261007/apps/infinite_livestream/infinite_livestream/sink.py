"""Encode the paced stream with ffmpeg and write it as an HLS playlist.

The page serves the playlist itself, so one HTTP origin (and one tunnel)
carries the whole demo. Latency is a segment plus the player's buffer, which
is irrelevant here because clips are pre-built anyway.

The pacer calls `send_video` once per frame period with one rgb24 frame of the
fixed size and `send_audio` once per period with one period of int16 samples,
forever. Four things about that contract are load-bearing:

  * ffmpeg reads both pipes as raw untimestamped bytes and derives every PTS
    from the byte count, so an entry dropped on one pipe and not the other
    shifts sound against picture permanently. Both are gated on the same
    `_ensure_running`, and any residual imbalance is logged as the skew it
    will cost. It cannot be repaired afterwards by withholding from the other
    pipe -- that starves ffmpeg's muxer and stalls the stream.
  * A frame whose byte count disagrees with `-s WxH` shifts every following
    scanline and the picture turns to static, so wrong-sized frames are
    refused rather than written.
  * `stdin.write` blocks when ffmpeg's input buffer fills, and blocking the
    event loop snowballs. Each pipe gets a writer thread behind a bounded
    queue.
  * ffmpeg exits on transient errors; the stream must not. It is restarted
    lazily on the next frame, with a cooldown and a failure cap.

Requires ffmpeg on PATH. Uses `pass_fds`, so Linux/macOS only.

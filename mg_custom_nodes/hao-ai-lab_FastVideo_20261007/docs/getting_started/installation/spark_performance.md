# DGX Spark (GB10): Performance & Tuning

You have FastVideo [installed on a DGX Spark](spark.md) — this page is what to
run next. It covers **which models are practical on the GB10, what actually
makes them faster, and what won't help (and why)**, so you don't burn a night
tuning knobs that can't move on this hardware.

!!! tip "TL;DR"
    - **Use distilled few-step models** (e.g. `FastVideo/FastWan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers`).
      They run in ~40 s/video. Full-step models are 12–47 min on the GB10.
    - On few-step models, **VAE decode is the bottleneck**, not attention — it's
      bandwidth-bound on the Spark's unified memory.
    - **bf16 VAE decode** is the real, lossless lever (FastVideo already turns it
      on for Wan). **FlashAttention, linear quantization, and `torch.compile` of
      the VAE give little or nothing here** — see the table below.
    - Heavy runs can make the box unreachable — run generations with VAE tiling on
      and `nice -n 19`. See [Running safely](#running-safely-dont-lock-the-box).

## The hardware reality (this explains everything below)

The GB10 pairs a Blackwell GPU (`sm_121`) with **128 GB of unified LPDDR5X memory
(~270 GB/s) shared between CPU and GPU**. That bandwidth is roughly **10× below a
datacenter GPU's HBM**. Two consequences drive every tuning decision:

1. **Memory-bandwidth-bound stages hurt disproportionately.** VAE decode moves a
   lot of data and becomes the dominant cost on short (few-step) generations.
2. **Compute-bound stages scale with step count.** Full-step diffusion (50+
   steps) is denoise-bound and simply takes a long time here.

## Use distilled few-step models

The single biggest lever on the GB10 is **model choice**. A 3-step distilled
model is ~18× faster than the full-step version of the same architecture:

| Model | Steps | Time / video | Bottleneck |
|---|---|---|---|
| FastWan2.1-T2V-1.3B (distilled) | 3 | **~40 s** | VAE decode |
| Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B (full-step) | 50 | ~12 min | denoise |
| Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B (full-step) | 51 | ~47 min | denoise |
| LTX2.3-distilled (+audio) | 8 | ~6 min | mixed |

The bottleneck flips from decode to denoise at around **4 steps**. Below that,
you're paying mostly for VAE decode; above it, mostly for the denoising loop.

!!! note "Few-step timings are noisy — measure in-process"
    On a 3-step run, one-time per-process startup (Triton autotune, allocator
    warmup) dominates and never amortizes, so single-run totals wobble ~±30%.
    Compare levers **back-to-back in one process or as medians**, never as two
    separate single runs. The [reproduction script](#reproduce-these-numbers)
    does this for you.

## bf16 VAE decode — the real lever (already on for Wan)

Because few-step generation is decode-bound, VAE decode precision is where the
time is. Decoding in **bf16 instead of fp32 is essentially lossless** (MS-SSIM
~0.9999 vs fp32 on the identical latent) and ~1.14× faster — worth roughly
5–7% end-to-end on a decode-bound few-step model.

**FastVideo already defaults Wan's decode to bf16** (`vae_decode_precision="bf16"`,
with encode kept at fp32), so for the recommended Wan/FastWan models there's
nothing to set. If you run a model that still defaults to an fp32 decode, set the
decode-only override yourself:

```python
from fastvideo.configs.pipelines.base import PipelineConfig

pipeline_config = PipelineConfig.from_pretrained(model_id)
pipeline_config.vae_decode_precision = "bf16"   # decode-only; leaves encode precision alone
```

Decode is output-only, so lowering its precision is safe. (Encode seeds the
denoising trajectory for I2V/causal models, so that stays at the pipeline's
default — don't lower `vae_precision` blindly for those.)

## Memory: one unified 128 GB pool

The GB10 has **no separate VRAM** — CPU and GPU share one 128 GB LPDDR5X pool
(~118 GB usable). Two practical consequences:

- **`nvidia-smi` reports memory as `[N/A]`** on the GB10, and the system "used"
  figure conflates CPU + GPU + cache, so it's only a soft upper bound — treat the
  whole 128 GB as one shared budget. For a worker-measured figure, use FastVideo's
  own `peak_memory_mb` (reported on the generation result and by the performance
  benchmark), which is measured inside the worker that runs the model. It is the
  worker's allocator high-water mark, never reset between generations, so it
  includes model load and every prior run rather than a single run's delta. The
  `mp` backend populates it; the Ray backend leaves `peak_memory_mb` unset, so
  `--execution-backend ray` prints no peak-memory figure.
- **The 128 GB is a *working-set* ceiling, not storage** — the model cache lives
  on the NVMe (3.7 TB, ample). What has to fit in 128 GB is the weights,
  activations, and KV cache — and, critically, the **VAE decode buffers**, which
  is why tiling matters
  (an untiled high-res decode can spike the pool into swap and lock the box).

The recommended few-step models are comfortable here: their weights are small
(1.3–2 B) and few-step generation keeps activations modest — a Wan2.1-1.3B
few-step generation peaks at **~8.4 GB** (measured), a small fraction of the pool.
The pressure comes from **decode resolution/frames**, not the model — a
1080p×121-frame untiled decode is what pushes the pool toward its ceiling, which
is why VAE tiling stays
on by default.

## What helps vs. what doesn't on the GB10

The honest summary — most "obvious" GPU optimizations don't move the needle on
this hardware, for reasons specific to it:

| Lever | Effect on the GB10 | Use it? |
|---|---|---|
| Distilled few-step model | ~18× vs full-step | ✅ **the primary lever** |
| bf16 VAE decode | ~1.14×, lossless; ~5–7% e2e on few-step | ✅ default for Wan |
| VSA (video sparse attention) | works out of the box (Triton kernel auto-selects on `sm_121`) | ✅ automatic |
| Building FlashAttention | **no speedup** — Torch SDPA already hits an efficient flash kernel on `sm_121`, and FA2 ties it | ❌ not worth building |
| `torch.compile` of the VAE decode | recompile storm (per-frame varying shapes) → ~1.1× | ❌ dead end |
| Linear (fp8 / nvfp4) quantization on long-sequence models (e.g. Cosmos) | ~nothing — see below | ❌ wrong lever here |
| FP4 attention (`ATTN_QAT_INFER`) | works on `sm_121` (runtime allowlist landed in #1647; kernel build is #1598); helps, but needs a QAT-trained checkpoint | ⚠️ opt-in — see below |
| FP4 linear on short-sequence models (LTX2) | up to −24% denoise at 1080p (#1594) | ⚠️ model/resolution-dependent |

### Why linear quantization is the wrong lever on long-sequence models

Quantizing the linear (GEMM) layers is a natural first instinct, but on a
long-sequence video model it buys almost nothing on the GB10. A video-DiT denoise
step is dominated by **O(N²) attention** at these sequence lengths (tens of
thousands of tokens); the linear layers are a small single-digit fraction of the
work. Quantizing them faster leaves the attention-bound total essentially
unchanged — measured at ~1% on Cosmos-2.5, i.e. noise, and full-step CFG models
also lose quality to per-step quantization error.

The same mechanism **does** help on **short-sequence** models: LTX2's aggressive
VAE compression gives it short attention sequences, so FP4 linear reaches −24%
there (#1594). The rule: **on the GB10, the lever that matters is attention
(sparse or FP4), not the linear layers** — unless the model has short sequences.

### FP4 on the GB10 (opt-in)

Block-scaled FP4 works on `sm_121` under CUDA 13:

- **FP4 attention** (`FASTVIDEO_ATTENTION_BACKEND=ATTN_QAT_INFER`, #1598) is
  numerically correct on the GB10 and ~6% faster end-to-end generation, but it only preserves
  quality on a **quantization-aware-distilled checkpoint** (e.g.
  `FastVideo/FastWan-QAD-1.3B`) — stock weights aren't trained to tolerate it.
- **FP4 linear** helps only where sequences are short (LTX2, above).

The [`qad_fp4_ab.py`](#reproduce-these-numbers) harness reproduces the FP4
attention A/B on the QAD checkpoint.

## Running safely (don't lock the box)

The GB10 is easy to make **unreachable** — a heavy build or an untiled high-res
decode starves the ~20 ARM cores and unified memory, `sshd` can't get cycles, and
you're locked out at *"Connection timed out during banner exchange"* until the box
is power-cycled. To avoid it:

- **Inference:** keep **VAE tiling on** (the default), use sane resolution/frames,
  and run under `nice -n 19`:

  ```bash
  nice -n 19 nohup python your_script.py > run.log 2>&1 &
  ```

- **Builds** (flash-attn, kernel): `nice -n 19`, `MAX_JOBS=2`, `nohup`. Never a
  bare foreground high-parallelism build.
- FastVideo automatically disables DiT layerwise/CPU offload and encoder/VAE CPU
  offload after each worker binds its GB10 device. Do not force those modes back
  on: "CPU" offload uses the same unified RAM. Multi-GPU FSDP sharding remains
  available because it partitions weights without parking them in a separate
  host pool.
- **Older MiniMax H3 / FastH3 bf16 weights** need deferred loading on one GB10.
  The full Qwen3-VL conditioner is tens of gigabytes of BF16. If the DiT and
  VAEs load while that encoder is still resident, the process can be killed by
  `earlyoom`. On unified memory, `lazy_module_load` auto-enables and owns that
  split (encoder, then DiT, then VAE; DiT can drop before decode). Sequential
  load is the H3-only fallback when lazy is off. Keep deferred loading for
  those older checkpoints. The trimmed NVFP4 encoder and light VAE in the
  [V2 resident recipe](#fasth3-v2-nvfp4-on-one-spark) are a different memory
  profile. Geometry scalars come from checkpoint `config.json`, not live
  weights. See [Offloading](../../inference/offloading.md).
- **FastH3 TAEH3** (`--video-decode-backend taeh3`) is an opt-in preview decoder.
  T2VA never materializes the 9.7 GiB video VAE (DiT still loads after Qwen via
  sequential start). On this box, alpine 768×1344×124 decoded in **2.4 s** versus
  **68 s** for the full VAE, and one T2VA generation finished in **224 s**
  end-to-end. Reconstruction is approximate, not lossless. FL2VA/Ref2VA still
  need the full VAE to encode references.
- **Two Sparks, one clip.** Sequence parallel (`sp_size=2`) over the QSFP RoCE
  link ran one 768×1344×124 FastH3 recipe in **292 s** vs **374–393 s** on
  one GB10, and a 345-frame (~14.4 s) clip in **587 s**. Other heights, widths,
  and frame counts are valid. Weights stay replicated, so lazy module load
  (auto on GB10) is still required on each box. Bring-up and knobs:
  [Pair two NVIDIA DGX Sparks](spark_pair.md).
- A worker's SIGTERM log and traceback show where it was interrupted, not why it
  was selected; confirm the cause in the `earlyoom` service or system logs. A
  later SIGKILL or kernel OOM kill cannot be caught and reported by Python.

## Gotchas specific to the GB10

A few things that surprise people on this box (beyond the memory notes above):

- **Don't force `TORCH_SDPA` on a VSA checkpoint** (FastWan, LTX2.3-distilled).
  The SDPA path builds a model without the gate weights the checkpoint carries and
  fails to load. Run the model natively — VSA auto-routes to its Triton kernel on
  `sm_121`.
- **Few-step timings are noisy run-to-run** (~±30%) — one-time startup dominates a
  3-step run. Compare in-process / as medians, never two separate single runs (the
  benchmark script does this).
- **`nvidia-smi` shows `[N/A]` for memory** — see [Memory](#memory-one-unified-128-gb-pool).
- **Cosmos-2.5** uses a Qwen2.5-VL text encoder; make sure you're on a FastVideo
  build recent enough to include its `transformers`-compatibility handling before
  running it.
- **MiniMax H3 worker init can look healthy and still die on the first generate**
  if deferred loading is off (`--no-lazy-module-load` and sequential also off)
  and encoder, VAE, and DiT load together. On GB10 the log should show
  `lazy_module_load owns deferral` (or, if lazy is off, sequential
  `Released MiniMax-H3 text encoder after conditioning` before
  `Loading MiniMax-H3 denoise modules`).

## FastH3 V2 NVFP4 on one Spark

This recipe uses the full V2 eight-forward transformer, the 50-layer NVFP4
Qwen3-VL encoder, and the light H3 video VAE. Its configuration keeps all
three resident on one GB10. This stack fits in the Spark's unified memory;
benchmark your installed runtime and review the clips before publishing a
speed claim. The earlier bf16 H3 memory guidance above concerns a larger checkpoint.

Install FastVideo following [the Spark install guide](spark.md). The released
repositories are complete inference stacks:

| Model | Repository | Packed DiT profile |
|---|---|---|
| FastH3 V2 | `FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-8-Step-V2-NVFP4-Consumer` | `h3_dit_vsa` |
| FastH3 Trim | `FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-Trim-8-Step-NVFP4` | `h3_dit_vsa` |

Each ships its own trained schedule, NVFP4 transformer and 50-layer NVFP4
text encoder, lightweight 26-layer video VAE with the INT8-weight overlay,
and audio VAE. Download the complete repository; the runtime selects these
components from its model index. The released Trim transformer also packs
attention and VSA gates, unlike the earlier FFN-only pruned export. Neither
release requires local checkpoint conversion or a separate encoder download.

```bash
hf download FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-8-Step-V2-NVFP4-Consumer
hf download FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-Trim-8-Step-NVFP4
```

Keep `fastvideo_inference.json` with the transformer if you stage the stack
in a local directory. It declares the trained eight-forward ladder and
video/audio shifts of 10/3. The recipes use `num_inference_steps: 9` for
nine sigma points and eight DiT forwards.

On GB10 with FlashInfer 0.6.18, FastVideo fences activation quantization before
releasing its padded input. Without this completion fence, identical H3
requests produced different DiT latents and occasionally corrupt video.
The fence applies to `sm_121`; other architectures retain asynchronous execution.

Run `examples/inference/basic/basic_fasth3_spark_v2_nvfp4.yaml` from the
repository root. It uses 832x480, 124 frames and seed 1234, VSA sparsity 0.8 with
64-token tiles, and the light H3 VAE through the `h3-vae` decode backend.
It does not use frame dropping or spatial upscaling.

```bash
FASTVIDEO_MINIMAX_H3_FUSIONS=all \
FASTVIDEO_NVFP4_MM_BACKEND=cutlass \
FASTVIDEO_H3_VAE_TILE_BATCH=1 \
FASTVIDEO_VSA_TRITON=1 FASTVIDEO_VSA_SM100A=0 FASTVIDEO_FA4=0 \
FASTVIDEO_ATTENTION_BACKEND=VIDEO_SPARSE_ATTN_H3 \
FASTVIDEO_STAGE_LOGGING=1 \
nice -n 19 fastvideo generate \
  --config examples/inference/basic/basic_fasth3_spark_v2_nvfp4.yaml
```

The defaults produce a roughly five-second clip at 24 fps. For native 768p,
set `--request.sampling.width 1344` and `--request.sampling.height 768`,
keeping 124 frames. For the separate ten-second setting, use 243 frames.
H3 permits frame counts of `17n+5`; 124 is the nearest legal count above
five seconds and 243 is the nearest above ten seconds.

For Trim, use `basic_fasth3_spark_pruned_nvfp4.yaml` with the same environment.
Both recipes keep the encoder, DiT and VAEs resident, disable compilation,
and use `h3_dit_vsa`. On two Sparks, use the corresponding
`basic_fasth3_spark_pair_{pruned,v2}_nvfp4.yaml` after following the
[pair setup guide](spark_pair.md). The pair uses SP2/TP1 and parallel VAE
gathering, with tile batch 1 on each worker.

For release timing, create one generator per model/resolution. Run one
untimed ceramics warmup, then two timed ceramics calls and two timed harbor
calls in that same process, using the exact release prompt strings, seed
1234 and the settings above. Measure each `generate()` call through finished
MP4 output and report the median of the two timed calls per prompt. Keep the
warmup excluded. Record the model revision, code commit, command, environment
and peak-memory scope with the results. Review every clip's video and audio
before publishing a quality or speed claim.

The benchmark helper requires a local stack so it can validate the schedule
before loading. For example:

```bash
hf download FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-8-Step-V2-NVFP4-Consumer \
  --local-dir ./FastH3-V2-Consumer
python examples/inference/basic/benchmark_fasth3_spark_nvfp4.py \
  --config examples/inference/basic/basic_fasth3_spark_v2_nvfp4.yaml \
  --model-path ./FastH3-V2-Consumer --frames 124 \
  --prompts /path/to/benchmark_prompts.json \
  --output-dir outputs/fasth3_spark_v2_nvfp4/benchmark-124
```

Set the environment from the generation command above before benchmarking.
The prompt JSON must contain `latency-ceramics-005` and
`latency-harbor-005`. Pass `--width 1344 --height 768` for the native 768p
protocol. Use the Trim repository and config for its corresponding run.

### Released model measurements

The released Trim stack at revision `cae9ceb6feefe77d34a56640782cda3909363f19`
completed the native 832x480, 124-frame protocol on one Spark, seed 1234.
The tested code is `6ccdbc761e6b854003f472e39b826c06cb54de60`, using the
resident recipe above. Medians exclude warmups and cover finished MP4 output.

| Released model | Resolution | One Spark, ceramics / harbor | Two Sparks |
|---|---|---:|---|
| FastH3 Trim NVFP4 | 832x480 | 124.090 / 127.519 s | Pending |
| FastH3 Trim NVFP4 | 1344x768 | Review pending | Pending |
| FastH3 V2 NVFP4-Consumer | 832x480 | Repeatability review pending | Pending |
| FastH3 V2 NVFP4-Consumer | 1344x768 | Review pending | Pending |

The completed Trim 480p batch used one extra untimed harbor warmup in the
same process, six calls total. Both warmups are excluded from the medians.
Each prompt's three decoded videos and audio streams match exactly, and
sampled frames are coherent. These checks do not establish BF16 parity,
speech accuracy or lip sync. Pending cells are not measured substitutes
from older checkpoints.

## Reproduce these numbers

Two scripts under `examples/inference/optimizations/` reproduce the claims on
your own GB10:

```bash
# Headline: few-step generation timing (median) + the bf16-vs-fp32 decode A/B.
# FASTVIDEO_STAGE_LOGGING=1 also prints the denoise / decode / text split.
FASTVIDEO_STAGE_LOGGING=1 nice -n 19 \
    python examples/inference/optimizations/spark_benchmark.py

# FP4 attention quality/speed A/B on the QAD checkpoint (one arm per run).
QAD_LINEAR=0 FASTVIDEO_ATTENTION_BACKEND=ATTN_QAT_INFER nice -n 19 \
    python examples/inference/optimizations/qad_fp4_ab.py
```

See also the [Optimizations](../../inference/optimizations.md) reference for the
full list of attention backends and quantization options.

# Training Infrastructure

FastVideo's training infrastructure (`fastvideo/train/`) is a YAML-driven
framework for training and distilling video diffusion models. A single config
file controls everything — models, algorithms, distributed strategy,
checkpointing, and validation — with no code changes needed to mix and match.

!!! note "Relationship to legacy training"
    This system replaces the older script-based training in `fastvideo/training/`.
    The legacy scripts still work for basic fine-tuning, but new development
    should use the config-driven system documented here.

---

## Quick Start

### Launch with the helper script

```bash
bash examples/train/run.sh examples/train/distill_wan2.1_t2v_1.3B_dmd2.yaml
```

The script auto-detects available GPUs and sets up `torchrun`. Override with
environment variables:

```bash
NUM_GPUS=4 NNODES=2 NODE_RANK=0 \
    MASTER_ADDR=10.0.0.1 MASTER_PORT=29501 \
    bash examples/train/run.sh my_config.yaml
```

### Launch directly with torchrun

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 \
    fastvideo/train/entrypoint/train.py \
    --config examples/train/distill_wan2.1_t2v_1.3B_dmd2.yaml
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--config` | Path to YAML config file (required) |
| `--resume-from-checkpoint` | Path to a DCP checkpoint directory to resume from |
| `--override-output-dir` | Override `training.checkpoint.output_dir` |
| `--dry-run` | Validate config and exit without training |

---

## Config Format

Every run is defined by a single YAML file with five top-level sections.
See `examples/train/configs/example.yaml` for a fully-commented reference.

### `models` — Role-based model instances

Each entry defines a model role. The `_target_` field specifies the Python class
to instantiate:

```yaml
models:
  student:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.WanModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: true
  teacher:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.WanModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: false
    disable_custom_init_weights: true
```

Common model parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `_target_` | *(required)* | Python class path for the model |
| `init_from` | *(required)* | HuggingFace repo ID or local checkpoint path |
| `trainable` | `true` | Whether the model's parameters require gradients |
| `disable_custom_init_weights` | `false` | Skip custom weight initialization (use for teacher/critic) |
| `flow_shift` | `3.0` | Timestep shifting factor |
| `enable_gradient_checkpointing_type` | `null` | Gradient checkpointing (`"full"`, `"ops"`, `"block_skip"`, or `null`); a role that leaves it unset uses `training.model`'s value |
| `attention_backend` | `null` | Optional role-local backend for Wan models (for example `ATTN_QAT_TRAIN`); overrides the process default only while this role's transformer is built |

`full` and `ops` checkpoint the same transformer blocks; layers outside them,
such as embeddings and the output head, keep their activations under either.
`full` recomputes every block operation and is the memory-conservative choice.
`ops` also retains the outputs of fused attention ops that the PyTorch
dispatcher can see. It can reduce recompute time at the cost of higher
activation memory, so use it only when the training shape has verified memory
headroom. `block_skip` currently behaves like `full`, because the modular
trainer has no setting for its layer interval.

These attention paths have no retainable dispatcher op, so they still
recompute in full under `ops`: math SDPA, VMoBA, SLA, `ATTN_QAT_TRAIN`, every
FA3 path, FA4 masked self-attention, FA4 below sm90, and CuTe VSA with 128- or
256-token blocks (`FASTVIDEO_VSA_CUTEDSL=1`). A run in which a checkpointed
block retains nothing logs a one-time warning. With sequence parallelism, the
Ulysses all-to-alls inside each block also run again during recompute.

Which roles are needed depends on the training method:

| Method | Required roles |
|--------|---------------|
| Fine-tune (SFT) | `student` |
| Diffusion-Forcing SFT | `student` |
| DMD2 | `student`, `teacher`, `critic` |
| Self-Forcing | `student` (causal), `teacher`, `critic` |

### `method` — Training algorithm

Selects and configures the training algorithm:

```yaml
method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.distribution_matching.dmd2.DMD2Method
  rollout_mode: simulate
  dmd_denoising_steps: [1000, 750, 500, 250]
  generator_update_interval: 5
```

To switch algorithms, change `_target_` and adjust the method-specific keys.
See [Training Methods](#training-methods) for details on each algorithm.

### `training` — Typed infrastructure config

This section maps to typed dataclasses with defaults and validation:

```yaml
training:
  distributed:
    num_gpus: 8
    sp_size: 1            # sequence parallelism
    tp_size: 1            # tensor parallelism
    hsdp_replicate_dim: 1 # HSDP replication dimension
    hsdp_shard_dim: 8     # HSDP sharding dimension

  data:
    data_path: data/my_dataset
    train_batch_size: 1
    dataloader_num_workers: 4
    training_cfg_rate: 0.1  # classifier-free guidance dropout rate
    seed: 1000
    num_latent_t: 20
    num_height: 448
    num_width: 832
    num_frames: 77

  optimizer:
    learning_rate: 2.0e-6
    betas: [0.9, 0.999]
    weight_decay: 0.01
    lr_scheduler: constant  # constant, linear, cosine, polynomial
    lr_warmup_steps: 0

  loop:
    max_train_steps: 4000
    gradient_accumulation_steps: 1

  checkpoint:
    output_dir: outputs/my_run
    training_state_checkpointing_steps: 1000  # 0 = disabled
    checkpoints_total_limit: 3                # 0 = keep all

  tracker:
    project_name: my_project
    run_name: my_run

  performance:
    enabled: true
    peak_tflops_per_gpu: null  # optional dense BF16 peak for one GPU

  model:
    weighting_scheme: uniform   # uniform, logit_normal, mode
    precondition_outputs: false
    enable_gradient_checkpointing_type: full

  vsa:
    sparsity: 0.0         # 0.0 = disabled
    decay_rate: 0.0
    decay_interval_steps: 0
```

`training.data.training_cfg_rate` enables classifier-free-guidance dropout. For most models the shared dataloader drops text conditioning by zeroing the stored embedding. LTX-2 is the exception: `LTX2Model` performs the drop itself and swaps in the checkpoint preset's unconditional embedding (the preset's `negative_prompt` — empty for the distilled presets, the quality-negative prompt for the base presets), because a zeroed post-connector embedding is not the model's unconditional input. The legacy `LTX2TrainingPipeline` (`fastvideo/training/`) does not implement the drop and rejects `training_cfg_rate > 0`.

`training.data.data_path` can also mix multiple preprocessed datasets by using a mapping from dataset path to repeat count:

```yaml
training:
  data:
    data_path:
      data/zeldam2-clean: 1
      data/multi3d_games: 2
```

The repeat count duplicates that dataset's parquet file list before shuffling/sampling, so the example above trains with roughly twice as much `multi3d_games` exposure as `zeldam2-clean`. Paths are just suggested locations; use any local path that contains a FastVideo preprocessed parquet dataset.

See [Training Trackers](trackers.md) to configure Weights & Biases or SwanLab,
including SwanLab installation and authentication.

### Training performance metrics

The modular trainer logs low-overhead performance metrics on every optimizer
step. The Transformer boundary is instrumented separately for each model role,
so the accounting includes all forwards performed by the selected method:

- bidirectional SFT records its dense or VSA student forward;
- causal SFT records block-causal attention geometry;
- streaming/self-forcing records every rollout chunk and KV-cache update;
- DMD records student, critic, and teacher forwards independently, including
  repeated rollouts and the conditional/unconditional teacher passes.

The common metrics are:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `step_time_sec` | Training wall time for one optimizer step, excluding checkpoint and validation callbacks |
| `perf/steps_per_sec` | Reciprocal of `step_time_sec` |
| `perf/samples_per_sec` | Configured global samples processed per second, including gradient accumulation and data-parallel replicas |
| `perf/model_forward_calls` | Actual Transformer invocations during the optimizer step |
| `perf/causal_chunks` | Block-causal chunks represented by those invocations |
| `perf/query_latent_frames_per_sec` | Latent query frames processed across all roles and rollouts |
| `perf/query_tokens_per_sec` | Patch tokens processed across all roles and rollouts |
| `perf/attention_density` | Effective self-attention pairs divided by dense attention pairs |
| `perf/estimated_tflops_per_gpu` | Estimated useful model FLOP/s per GPU |
| `perf/estimated_mfu` | Estimated useful FLOP/s divided by the dense BF16 peak (ratio, not percent) |
| `perf/peak_tflops_per_gpu` | Dense BF16 peak used for the MFU ratio (configured or inferred) |
| `perf/role/<role>/*` | Forward count, grad-carrying forward count, causal chunks, and estimated TFLOP/s for one role |

For DMD2, combine these metrics with the existing `update_student` metric to
separate the expensive generator-update steps from critic-only steps.

`perf/samples_per_sec` uses the configured `train_batch_size`, gradient
accumulation, and data-parallel replica count. Methods that manage their own
optimization (for example DiffusionNFT, whose outer step consumes
`num_batches_per_epoch` dataloader batches) report the throughput of a single
batch in the denominator, so use the method's own sample counter
(`nft/num_sampled`) for those runs. The FLOP-derived metrics still aggregate
every forward the method performs.

MFU is an analytic Transformer-core estimate. Each no-grad forward contributes
`1F`; a forward whose result carries autograd contributes `3F` (forward plus an
approximately `2F` backward). Activation-checkpoint recomputation is excluded,
as expected for model FLOPs utilization. Wan VSA uses the kernel's clamped
tile-top-k density and includes its gate projection and pooled-attention
overhead. VMOBA runs are modeled as dense self-attention: the MoBA top-k
selection is not estimated, so `perf/attention_density` stays at `1.0` and the
attention-dependent FLOPs are an upper bound. Causal Wan uses the configured
chunk size, local window, and actual streaming cache position; when
`local_attn_size` is unset, the modeled window is the transformer's 21-frame
compatibility cap, and `pipeline.dit_config.sliding_window_num_frames` only
sizes the streaming KV cache. MatrixGame2's 15-frame compatibility window is
not modeled, so its attention density is an upper bound. Embedding,
normalization, optimizer, communication, MatrixGame action modules, and other
non-core work are not included, so MFU is an estimate rather than a
hardware-profiler measurement.

`perf/estimated_tflops_per_gpu` and `perf/estimated_mfu` aggregate every role
(student, teacher, critic, EMA) that ran during the step, so they are not
directly comparable to a single-model MFU number. Replica scaling assumes
`world_size = data_parallel x sp_size`; `tp_size > 1` is not modeled and would
inflate the per-GPU estimates.

Forward counts and wall-clock throughput work for every modular model. The
FLOP-derived metrics currently require a Wan-style architecture exposing
`hidden_size`, `ffn_dim`, `num_layers`, and a three-axis `patch_size`; they are
omitted for other architectures instead of reporting a misleading estimate.

Known NVIDIA accelerators use an inferred dense BF16 peak. Set
`training.performance.peak_tflops_per_gpu` explicitly for a different board
form factor or clock. If the device is unknown and no peak is configured, the
trainer still logs throughput, call counts, attention density, and estimated
TFLOP/s, but omits `perf/estimated_mfu`. Set `enabled: false` to disable the
forward hooks and all `perf/*` metrics.

### `callbacks` — Pluggable hooks

Callbacks run at specific points in the training loop (before/after optimizer
steps, at validation time, etc.):

```yaml
callbacks:
  grad_clip:
    max_grad_norm: 1.0

  ema:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.callbacks.ema.EMACallback
    decay: 0.9999
    start_iter: 0

  validation:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.callbacks.validation.ValidationCallback
    pipeline_target: fastvideo.pipelines.basic.wan.wan_pipeline.WanPipeline
    dataset_file: path/to/validation.json
    every_steps: 100
    sampling_steps: [4]
    guidance_scale: 5.0
```

See [Callbacks](#callbacks) for details on each callback.

### `pipeline` — Inference pipeline overrides

Optional overrides for the inference pipeline used during validation:

```yaml
pipeline:
  flow_shift: 8
```

Registered transformer linear-quantization configs can also be selected by
name. For example, the LTX-2 NVFP4-QAT recipe applies real FP4 forward GEMMs
with a straight-through-estimator backward to its deployment-targeted
attention/FFN projections:

```yaml
pipeline:
  dit_config:
    quant_config: nvfp4_qat_train
```

The LTX-2 recipe in
`examples/train/configs/overfit_ltx2_t2v_nvfp4_qat.yaml` combines that linear
configuration with `models.student.attention_backend: ATTN_QAT_TRAIN` for
video-attention forward/backward. On sm120, its validation callback temporarily
switches those layers to `ATTN_QAT_INFER`.
On GB200, set `callbacks.validation.attn_qat_infer: false` to keep validation on
the train-time QAT backend; the inference kernel is sm120-only.

User-adaptable LTX-2 fine-tuning recipes (full, LoRA, and NVFP4 QAT) live in
`examples/train/configs/fine_tuning/ltx2/`, alongside the other model
families under `examples/train/configs/fine_tuning/`.

## Training Methods

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Standard flow-matching loss. The simplest method — train the student to predict
noise (or clean x0) from noised data samples.

```yaml
models:
  student:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.WanModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: true

method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.fine_tuning.finetune.FineTuneMethod
  attn_kind: dense   # "dense" or "vsa"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `attn_kind` | `"dense"` | Attention mode: `"dense"` (standard) or `"vsa"` (sparse) |

### Diffusion-Forcing SFT (DFSFT)

SFT with **per-chunk inhomogeneous timesteps** — each temporal chunk of the
video gets a different noise level. This is a prerequisite for training causal /
streaming models that must handle mixed-noise inputs.

```yaml
method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.fine_tuning.dfsft.DiffusionForcingSFTMethod
  chunk_size: 3
  min_timestep_ratio: 0.0
  max_timestep_ratio: 1.0
  attn_kind: dense
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `chunk_size` | `3` | Latent frames per temporal chunk |
| `min_timestep_ratio` | `0.0` | Lower bound of timestep sampling range |
| `max_timestep_ratio` | `1.0` | Upper bound of timestep sampling range |
| `attn_kind` | `"dense"` | `"dense"` or `"vsa"` |

### DMD2 (Distribution Matching Distillation)

Distill a many-step teacher into a few-step student. The student learns to match
the teacher's score function, guided by a trainable critic network.

```yaml
models:
  student:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.WanModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: true
  teacher:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.WanModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: false
    disable_custom_init_weights: true
  critic:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.WanModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: true
    disable_custom_init_weights: true

method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.distribution_matching.dmd2.DMD2Method
  rollout_mode: simulate
  dmd_denoising_steps: [1000, 750, 500, 250]
  generator_update_interval: 5
  real_score_guidance_scale: 4.5

  fake_score_learning_rate: 8.0e-6
  fake_score_betas: [0.0, 0.999]
  fake_score_lr_scheduler: constant
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `rollout_mode` | *(required)* | `"simulate"` (pure noise) or `"data_latent"` (from data) |
| `dmd_denoising_steps` | *(required)* | Timestep schedule for student rollout |
| `generator_update_interval` | `1` | Update student every N critic steps |
| `real_score_guidance_scale` | `1.0` | CFG scale for teacher predictions |
| `min_timestep_ratio` | `0.0` | Lower bound for randomly sampled teacher/critic score timesteps |
| `max_timestep_ratio` | `1.0` | Upper bound for randomly sampled teacher/critic score timesteps |
| `fake_score_learning_rate` | *(required)* | Critic optimizer learning rate |
| `fake_score_betas` | *(required)* | Critic optimizer Adam betas |
| `fake_score_lr_scheduler` | *(required)* | Critic LR scheduler type |

### Self-Forcing (Causal DMD)

Extends DMD2 for **streaming / causal video generation**. The student processes
video in temporal chunks, feeding its own denoised outputs as context for future
chunks — simulating autoregressive rollout during training.

Requires a causal model class (e.g., `WanCausalModel`) for the student:

```yaml
models:
  student:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.wan.wan_causal.WanCausalModel
    init_from: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
    trainable: true

method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.distribution_matching.self_forcing.SelfForcingMethod
  rollout_mode: simulate
  dmd_denoising_steps: [1000, 750, 500, 250]
  student_sample_type: sde
  context_noise: 0.0
  enable_gradient_in_rollout: true
  start_gradient_frame: 0
```

Self-Forcing inherits all DMD2 parameters, plus:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `student_sample_type` | `"sde"` | `"sde"` or `"ode"` for intermediate steps |
| `same_step_across_blocks` | `false` | Use same exit timestep for all blocks |
| `last_step_only` | `false` | Always exit at the final denoising step |
| `context_noise` | `0.0` | Noise added to context frames (0 = clean) |
| `enable_gradient_in_rollout` | `true` | Enable backprop through rollout |
| `start_gradient_frame` | `0` | Frame index where gradients begin |

### Streaming Long Tuning

`StreamingLongTuningMethod` extends Self-Forcing for LongLive-style rollouts. It
keeps a streaming state, generates overlapping chunks, and trains only the new
frames while preserving context from earlier chunks.

For the MatrixGame2/Zelda world-model example, self-forcing and long tuning are
separate runs: first train or load the 1k-step self-forcing checkpoint using
`examples/train/scenario/worldmodel/zelda/self_forcing_causal_i2v.yaml`,
then run
`examples/train/scenario/worldmodel/zelda/streaming_long_tuning_causal_i2v.yaml`
from that checkpoint for the 3k-step streaming long-tuning stage.

```yaml
method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.distribution_matching.streaming_long_tuning.StreamingLongTuningMethod
  streaming_chunk_size: 9
  streaming_max_length: 39
  streaming_fixed_overlap_latents: 3
  streaming_reencode_overlap_anchor: true
  streaming_anchor_inject_k: 1
  streaming_require_full_blocks: true
  multi_phased_distill_schedule:
    - stage: streaming_long
      start_step: 0
      end_step: 3000
      num_latent_t: 39
      streaming_training: true
```

See
`examples/train/scenario/worldmodel/zelda/streaming_long_tuning_causal_i2v.yaml`
for a complete MatrixGame2/Zelda configuration.

---

## Callbacks

Callbacks are pluggable hooks that run at specific points in the training loop.
Configure them under the `callbacks` section.

### GradNormClipCallback

Clips gradient norms before the optimizer step. Optionally logs per-module
gradient norms to the tracker.

```yaml
callbacks:
  grad_clip:
    max_grad_norm: 1.0      # 0.0 = disabled
    log_grad_norms: false
```

### EMACallback

Maintains an exponential moving average of the student's weights. The EMA
weights are automatically swapped in during validation.

```yaml
callbacks:
  ema:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.callbacks.ema.EMACallback
    decay: 0.9999
    start_iter: 0   # delay EMA updates until this iteration
```

The EMA callback owns its own state and checkpoints independently — EMA weights
are saved and restored automatically on resume.

### ValidationCallback

Runs inference with the trained model at regular intervals, saving generated
videos and logging them to the tracker (W&B).

```yaml
callbacks:
  validation:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.callbacks.validation.ValidationCallback
    pipeline_target: fastvideo.pipelines.basic.wan.wan_pipeline.WanPipeline
    dataset_file: path/to/validation.json
    every_steps: 100
    sampling_steps: [4]
    sampling_timesteps: [1000, 750, 500, 250]  # explicit timestep list
    guidance_scale: 5.0
    rollout_mode: parallel  # "parallel" or "streaming"
```

The validation dataset is a JSON file containing a list of prompt strings.
If EMA is enabled, validation automatically uses the EMA weights.

---

## Checkpointing and Resume

### Checkpoint format

Checkpoints use PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint (DCP) format, compatible with
FSDP/HSDP sharding. Each checkpoint saves:

- Model weights (all roles)
- Optimizer states (all roles)
- LR scheduler states
- RNG states (for exact reproducibility)
- EMA shadow weights (if enabled)
- Training step counter

Checkpoints are saved to `<output_dir>/checkpoint-<step>/`.

### Saving checkpoints

```yaml
training:
  checkpoint:
    output_dir: outputs/my_run
    training_state_checkpointing_steps: 1000  # save every N steps (0 = off)
    checkpoints_total_limit: 3                # rolling window (0 = keep all)
```

### Resuming training

Use `--resume-from-checkpoint` to resume from a specific checkpoint:

```bash
# Via the helper script
bash examples/train/run.sh my_config.yaml --resume outputs/my_run/checkpoint-2000

# Via torchrun directly
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 \
    fastvideo/train/entrypoint/train.py \
    --config my_config.yaml \
    --resume-from-checkpoint outputs/my_run/checkpoint-2000
```

Or set it in the YAML:

```yaml
training:
  checkpoint:
    resume_from_checkpoint: outputs/my_run/checkpoint-2000
```

### Reproducibility

The training entrypoint enables deterministic mode automatically:

- `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`
- `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`
- `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`

A shared CUDA RNG generator is seeded from `training.data.seed` and threaded
through all random operations (noise sampling, timestep sampling, etc.).
Ranks within the same sequence-parallel group share a seed, ensuring identical
noise across SP shards.

---

## Distributed Training

The framework supports HSDP (Hybrid Sharded Data Parallel), Tensor Parallelism
(TP), and Sequence Parallelism (SP):

```yaml
training:
  distributed:
    num_gpus: 8
    sp_size: 1            # sequence parallelism group size
    tp_size: 1            # tensor parallelism group size
    hsdp_replicate_dim: 1 # number of HSDP replicas
    hsdp_shard_dim: 8     # number of HSDP shards
```

**HSDP** shards model parameters across `hsdp_shard_dim` GPUs and replicates
across `hsdp_replicate_dim` groups. The product
`hsdp_replicate_dim * hsdp_shard_dim` should equal `num_gpus`.

**Sequence parallelism** splits the sequence (video frames) across `sp_size`
GPUs within each data-parallel group. Useful for long videos that don't fit on a
single GPU.

---

## VSA (Variable Sparse Attention)

VSA progressively increases attention sparsity during training, reducing compute
while maintaining quality:

```yaml
training:
  vsa:
    sparsity: 0.9             # target sparsity level
    decay_rate: 0.03          # sparsity increment per decay interval
    decay_interval_steps: 1   # steps between sparsity increases
```

The effective sparsity at step `t` is
`min(sparsity, decay_rate * (t // decay_interval_steps))`.

---

## Extending the Framework

### Adding a new model

1. Create a new module under `fastvideo/train/models/` (e.g.,
   `fastvideo/train/models/mymodel/mymodel.py`).
2. Subclass `ModelBase` (or `CausalModelBase` for streaming models).
3. Implement the required methods:
   - `prepare_batch()` — convert raw dataloader output to `TrainingBatch`
   - `add_noise()` — forward-process noise addition
   - `predict_noise()` — run the transformer forward pass
   - `backward()` — backward pass with forward context restoration
4. Reference it in your YAML config:

```yaml
models:
  student:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.models.mymodel.mymodel.MyModel
    init_from: my-org/my-model
    trainable: true
```

### Adding a new training method

1. Create a new module under `fastvideo/train/methods/`.
2. Subclass `TrainingMethod`.
3. Implement the required methods:
   - `single_train_step()` — one forward pass returning losses, outputs, metrics
   - `get_optimizers()` — return optimizer list
   - `get_lr_schedulers()` — return scheduler list
4. Reference it in your config:

```yaml
method:
  _target_: fastvideo.train.methods.my_method.MyMethod
  my_param: 42
```

Method-specific parameters are accessible via `self.method_config` (a plain
dict).

### Adding a new callback

1. Create a new module under `fastvideo/train/callbacks/`.
2. Subclass `Callback`.
3. Override the hooks you need: `on_train_start`, `on_training_step_end`,
   `on_before_optimizer_step`, etc.
4. Optionally implement `state_dict()` / `load_state_dict()` for checkpoint
   persistence.
5. Add it to your config:

```yaml
callbacks:
  my_callback:
    _target_: fastvideo.train.callbacks.my_callback.MyCallback
    my_param: 42
```

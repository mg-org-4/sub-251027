"""Audio conditioning stage for speech-driven video (Wan2.2-S2V).

Text has a tokenizer because language is discrete -- a finite vocabulary you can
look words up in. Audio has none: a waveform is a continuous stream, so the
"tokens" are manufactured by slicing time and learning features, not by lookup.
This stage does that: load -> resample to wav2vec2's 16kHz -> encode -> resample
the feature stream to the video frame rate -> bucket into a per-frame window.

The resampling is the load-bearing part. If the audio feature stream and the
video latents disagree on frame count, nothing crashes -- the lips just drift
out of sync. ``verify_output`` pins the frame count for that reason.

The waveform itself is also kept on ``batch.extra["audio"]`` so the saved MP4
carries the speech track, the same convention the LTX-2 and MagiHuman audio
stages use.

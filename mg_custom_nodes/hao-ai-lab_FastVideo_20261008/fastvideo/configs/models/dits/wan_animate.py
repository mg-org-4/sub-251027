"""Arch config for Wan2.2-Animate-14B (character animation / replacement).

Every value is transcribed verbatim from
``Wan-AI/Wan2.2-Animate-14B-Diffusers/transformer/config.json`` -- do not
"tidy" them. Field names match that file's keys one-for-one because
``update_model_arch`` overlays any matching key from the checkpoint's
config.json at load time; a renamed field silently stops receiving its
checkpoint value.

The tower itself is the Wan-I2V one (this class only switches on the I2V
knobs ``image_dim``/``added_kv_proj_dim``); why that is the right base is
explained on ``WanAnimate14BConfig`` in ``models/wan/pipeline_config.py``. What
Animate adds on top:

* ``in_channels = 36 = 16 (noise) + 4 (mask) + 16 (conditional latent)``.
* ``pose_patch_embedding`` -- a second patchifier whose output is added to
  the video tokens (skipping the reference latent frame).
* A LIA-style motion encoder (``motion_*`` fields) turning 512x512 face crops
  into 20-dim motion codes. The checkpoint stores its conv/linear weights
  **unit-scale**: the model must apply the StyleGAN2 runtime factor
  (``1/sqrt(fan_in)``) in forward. Loading these into vanilla
  ``nn.Conv2d``/``nn.Linear`` forwards succeeds and is silently wrong.
* A face encoder + ``face_adapter`` cross-attention blocks. The checkpoint
  indexes the adapters densely (``face_adapter.0 .. .7``) with no record of
  which transformer block each serves; adapter ``i`` serves block
  ``i * inject_face_latents_blocks``. That correspondence exists only here,
  so it is asserted in ``__post_init__`` -- a wrong value loads cleanly and
  steers the wrong blocks.

Naming contract with the model (``fastvideo/models/dits/wan_animate.py``):
the Animate-specific modules keep checkpoint-identical parameter names
(``motion_encoder.*``, ``face_encoder.*``, ``face_adapter.*``) so the loader
passes them through verbatim; only ``pose_patch_embedding`` needs a mapping
entry, mirroring how the base ``patch_embedding`` is wrapped in ``.proj``.

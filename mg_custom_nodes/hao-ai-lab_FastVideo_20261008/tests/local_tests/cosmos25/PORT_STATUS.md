## Conversion State
- conversion_script: `scripts/checkpoint_conversion/cosmos25_distilled_to_diffusers.py`
- converted_weights_dir: `~/models/Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B-Distilled-TrigFlow-FastVideo`
- source_layout: official `base/distilled` checkpoint
- strict_load_status: pass; 685 student tensors, no training counters, production FastVideo loader pass
- passthrough_components: Reason1 encoder and tokenizer VAE are expected to reuse the existing Cosmos25 layout
- retry_history: synthetic contracts pass; released 3.9 GB checkpoint converted in 22.5 s to a 20 GB package

DFD conversion target:

- conversion_script: `scripts/checkpoint_conversion/cosmos25_dfd_to_diffusers.py`
- source_layout: extracted PyTorch DCP directory (`0000040.net_model`)
- strict_load_status: pass; 569 student tensors, 2,059,174,912 parameters, production FastVideo loader pass
- passthrough_components: Cosmos25 VAE, Reason1 encoder, tokenizer, and safety checker from an existing FastVideo package
- retry_history: synthetic DCP contract authored; local execution environment lacks the repository runtime dependencies

## Open Questions
| ID | Question | Owner | Needed By Phase | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q001 | What packaged Diffusers-style model ID should carry the distilled scheduler and converted student weights? | conversion | conversion | open | pending |
| Q002 | Does experimental distilled V2W retain acceptable quality after official T2W parity? | pipeline | post-parity experiment | closed | DFD checkpoint selected instead; hybrid T2W-to-DFD and DFD-to-DFD visual gates passed on 2026-09-10 |
| Q003 | Can the DFD DCP state dict be converted without instantiating the upstream teacher/training graph? | conversion | conversion | closed | `dcp_to_torch_save` materializes the student state for key normalization without building any training-only network |
| Q004 | What public FastVideo package IDs should carry the T2W and DFD students? | conversion | release | open | pending |

## Issues And Blockers
| ID | Phase | Component | Severity | Issue | Evidence | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I001 | parity | student DiT | high | No non-skip real-weight distilled forward comparison yet | Spark official-vs-FastVideo BF16 comparison | parity | closed | passed at final relative mean 0.038397 |
| I002 | conversion | packaged model | high | Released official checkpoint is not yet isolated in a FastVideo-loadable component layout | Converted package and strict production load | conversion | closed | 685 clean student tensors; load pass |
| I003 | pipeline | T2W | high | End-to-end distilled generation is not yet validated | small and full-resolution Spark runs plus visual inspection | pipeline | closed | full T2W quality gate passed |
| I004 | prep | DFD checkpoint | medium | Public release has no `model_index.json` and stores the student as zipped PyTorch DCP shards | HF metadata inspection; seven-file custom layout | conversion | closed | real DCP converted to 569-tensor, 2.059B-parameter package and strict-loaded successfully |
| I005 | pipeline | DFD V2W | high | Converted-package visual quality has not yet been accepted | production 704x1280x81 generation, numerical boundary check, and visual inspection | parity | closed | condition boundary is seamless, the requested right pan occurs correctly, motion is slightly slow but acceptable, and no blocking artifacts were observed |

## Escape Hatches
| ID | Phase | Decision Type | Question | Recommended Option | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-27 | Implement a Cosmos-specific sampler instead of reusing RCM | RCM uses different times and fresh per-step noise | Preserves TurboDiffusion behavior and official Cosmos equations |
| 2026-08-27 | Support the released distilled checkpoint as T2W first | NVIDIA documents the released distilled checkpoint for T2W | No V2W/rolling claim before experimental validation |
| 2026-08-27 | Keep the existing full-step Cosmos25 path unchanged | Distilled and post-trained checkpoints require different inference semantics | Avoids regression for current users |
| 2026-08-27 | Defer pipeline wiring until real-weight component parity | Required by the repository add-model workflow | Next GPU task is DiT parity, not generation |
| 2026-08-27 | Preserve native `net.*` student keys during conversion | Existing Cosmos25 loader owns the authoritative mapping | Converter only isolates student tensors and emits package metadata |
| 2026-08-27 | Accept calibrated BF16 DiT parity | Preprocess is exact, first-block drift is 0.000655 relative, and drift grows smoothly to 0.038397 final relative | Clears the component gate without claiming bitwise equality |
| 2026-08-27 | Select distilled stages from the packaged scheduler class | The package already carries authoritative inference semantics | Existing full Cosmos2.5 packages remain on their unchanged path |
| 2026-08-27 | Accept the full-resolution T2W quality gate | The four-step 704x1280x77 run completed without runtime faults and passed visual inspection | Clears basic FastVideo T2W support; does not claim continuation or real-time latency |
| 2026-08-27 | Accept the decoded-frame return contract | The small Spark run returned 9 RGB frames with shape `(256, 448, 3)` without writing an MP4 | Clears the downstream frame-consumer contract without claiming DreamVerse integration |
| 2026-09-10 | Retain the distilled T2W student as the DreamVerse bootstrap model | The published DFD checkpoint requires an input image | Segment 1 uses T2W; later segments use DFD V2W |
| 2026-09-10 | Port DFD as a distinct scheduler/checkpoint profile | DFD uses rectified-flow ODE steps, not the fixed-noise TrigFlow rollout | Existing T2W behavior stays isolated and unchanged |
| 2026-09-10 | Standardize the hybrid runtime at 24 FPS | Both Cosmos networks use 24 FPS temporal encoding; the DFD CLI's `--fps` only controls student output container metadata | DreamVerse should stream at 24 FPS and trim the repeated DFD frame |
| 2026-09-10 | Treat the reference hybrid eye gate as model evidence, not native-port parity | T2W-to-DFD and DFD-to-DFD boundaries were seamless and the changed prompt produced the requested pivot | Clears model selection while retaining native parity requirements |
| 2026-09-10 | Rebuild PR 1768 as a dedicated `GenerationBackend` | Merged FastH3 established the model-owned lifecycle and continuation boundary | Cosmos will not add conditionals to the LTX2 backend or revive the removed shared generation implementation |
| 2026-09-10 | Keep two explicit Cosmos package roles in the backend | The public DFD model cannot create an unconditioned first segment, while the released TrigFlow student cannot continue a frame | Segment 1 uses the bootstrap package unless the user supplies an initial image; all conditioned segments use the DFD package |
| 2026-09-10 | Synthesize silent 24 kHz audio in the Cosmos backend | DreamVerse's fMP4 streamer currently requires an audio track | Video-only Cosmos output remains streamable without changing the shared AV contract |
| 2026-09-11 | Accept DFD real-weight DiT parity and begin pipeline wiring | Exact preprocessing and bounded 1.986% aggregate BF16 drift show the reused transformer implements the DFD student | Clears the add-model component gate; does not yet clear the four-step pipeline gate |
| 2026-09-11 | Use a dedicated scheduler-selected DFD V2W route | The DFD checkpoint has fixed geometry, FPS, timestep, mask, and first-frame semantics distinct from both base Cosmos and TrigFlow T2W | Existing Cosmos paths remain unchanged; DFD validates 704x1280x81 at 24 FPS and four steps |
| 2026-09-11 | Accept native DFD four-step rollout parity | The real-weight FastVideo rollout passed against upstream with identical initial state and conditioning tensors | Clears the native pipeline gate; converted-package loading and decoded-video quality remain |
| 2026-09-11 | Accept real DFD conversion and production runtime smoke | The inference-only package contains 569 student tensors/2.059B parameters and completed 704x1280x81 generation | Clears conversion, strict-load, execution, decode, and save gates; visual acceptance remains |
| 2026-09-11 | Accept the native DFD visual quality gate | The conditioning boundary was seamless, the requested right pan occurred correctly, and the slightly slow motion remained acceptable without blocking artifacts | Completes the model-port validation; DreamVerse still owns removal of the repeated continuation frame |

## Handoff Notes
- Existing T2W tests and all DFD scheduler, transformer, isolated pipeline, and full-rollout parity gates pass on the Spark validation host.
- Released checkpoint conversion, production strict load, and official-vs-FastVideo DiT parity pass on Spark.
- Small and full-resolution T2W generation pass on Spark; the full video passed visual inspection.
- The `save_video=False`, `return_frames=True` result contract passes on Spark.
- A public converted package ID remains open; until then, use the documented local conversion flow.
- The real DFD DCP converted to `/home/raghav/models/Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B-DFD-FastVideo`, strict-loaded at 2.06B parameters, and completed the production four-step I2W smoke in 147.66 seconds end to end.
- The native DFD video's conditioning-to-frame-0 MAE was 2.845 versus a 52.131 conditioning-to-final-frame control. Visual inspection accepted the seamless boundary and correct right pan; motion was slightly slow but acceptable.
- Do not use the prior FlowUniPC/Karras Spark run as distilled parity evidence.
- DFD reference commit is staged under ignored `DFDReference/`; no weights or dependencies were downloaded locally.
- Public DFD reference inference passed one T2W-to-DFD and one DFD-to-DFD continuation with boundary MAE 2.694 and 2.459; the unrelated control was 39.142.
- DreamVerse integration must follow the merged `GenerationBackend` boundary from PR #1800 rather than modifying the former shared `video_generation.py` implementation.
- The 1768 rewrite should own two generators or an equivalent safe weight-switching lifecycle, retain a copied RGB terminal frame, trim one video frame plus one frame-equivalent of synthesized silence on DFD continuations, and warm both bootstrap and continuation paths before readiness.

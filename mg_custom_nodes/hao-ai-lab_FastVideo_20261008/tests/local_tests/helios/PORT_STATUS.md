## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Owner | Needed By Phase | Status | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q001 | Is `transformer_ode` required for Distilled T2V? | orchestrator | Phase 1 | resolved | No model index or official T2V call loads it; excluded. |
| Q002 | Can the native Wan VAE be reused? | component:vae | Phase 3 | resolved | Exact config/weight strict load and decode parity are bit-exact. |
| Q003 | Can native UMT5/tokenizer be reused? | component:encoder | Phase 3 | resolved | Token IDs/masks exact; FP32 and BF16 output parity pass. |
| Q004 | Where do Helios DMD runtime fields live? | component:scheduler | Phase 1 | resolved | Scheduler owns sigma/timestep math; public per-call knobs live in SamplingParam/preset. |

## Issues And Blockers

| ID | Phase | Component | Severity | Issue | Evidence | Owner | Status | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I001 | prep | environment | medium | No project venv initially. | system Python lacked ML deps | prep | resolved | Python 3.12 project venv installed. |
| I002 | prep | repository | low | Early branch was behind main. | rev-list showed upstream commits | prep | resolved | Final integration branch rebased on `a159b63c`. |
| I003 | prep | weights | low | Snapshot includes unused 58 GB ODE transformer. | model indexes omit `transformer_ode` | orchestrator | resolved | Pinned inference assets downloaded without ODE directory. |
| I004 | parity | tokenizer | low | Direct loader import had a repository-root import cycle in the older workspace. | collection traceback | orchestrator | resolved_for_test | Production loader runs in a clean subprocess. |
| I005 | official_reference | CUDA accounting | low | Peak reset initially used an invalid device after offload hooks. | runtime error before inference | orchestrator | resolved | Set current device before hooks; parity completes. |
| I006 | transformer | RoPE buffers | medium | Meta construction left non-persistent RoPE buffers on meta. | meta/cuda einsum mismatch | component:transformer | resolved | Loader materializes exact buffers. |
| I007 | encoder | BF16 drift | low | Fused-QKV and three-GEMM paths differ slightly. | max 0.0234375, mean 0.00160135 | component:encoder | resolved | FP32 proves math; separate bounded BF16 gate passes. |
| I008 | pipeline | history geometry | high | Coarse-stage history RoPE used current-grid positions. | 294 history tokens versus 72 positions | component:transformer | resolved | Short-grid positions are center-downsampled for mid/long histories. |
| I009 | pipeline | guidance cross-attention | medium | History and current queries were combined before masking. | activation trace diverged | component:transformer | resolved | Current/history split occurs before cross-attention. |
| I010 | tests | repository package root | low | A root `__init__.py` makes invalid worktree basenames fail mypy. | `helios-pr... is not a valid Python package name` | orchestrator | resolved | Worktree basename changed to `helios_pr1670_full_pipeline`. |
| I011 | registry | variant safety | high | Broad Helios detection would route Base/Mid to Distilled. | negative metadata probes | orchestrator | resolved | Require pipeline class, `is_distilled=true`, and Helios DMD scheduler. |
| I012 | quality | tiny smoke | medium | 128×192 is not a visual-quality target. | poor-detail local smoke | orchestrator | resolved_as_scope | Public example and integrity gate use 384×640. |
| I013 | distributed | nightly coverage | medium | FSDP+SP and repeated-run coverage are not a committed CI lane. | Real 2-GPU FSDP+SP=2 production inference passed on 2026-09-12; no scheduled lane exists. | orchestrator | open_nightly | Current review regression is resolved; scheduled repeated-run coverage remains follow-up. |
| I014 | production_validation | multiprocessing output | high | Returning GPU output through CUDA IPC OOMed while the 14.31B DiT remained resident. | v1 completed stages then failed in `_new_shared_cuda` | pipeline | resolved | Decode/latent outputs move to CPU inside worker; regression is GREEN and typed example v2 passes. |
| I015 | final_verification | upstream main | high | Integration base `6388db81` had eight unrelated unit-lane failures. | 909 passed and 8 failed before upstream CI/schema fixes. | upstream | resolved | Rebased through `b2062556` onto `a159b63c`; the current shared unit script passes all 1047 tests. |
| I016 | final_verification | upstream main | medium | The current full unit lane has five order-sensitive NVFP4/LoRA wiring failures. | Both this branch and untouched `main@a943220c` report the same 5 failures; the file passes alone with 15 passed, 1 skipped. | upstream | baseline_reproduced | Not caused by Helios; targeted Helios and loader gates pass. |
| I017 | distributed | transformer loader | high | GPU-direct checkpoint staging peaked near 47.3 GiB per rank while FSDP shards materialized on discrete 48 GB GPUs. | Both ranks reached the sixth checkpoint shard and OOMed before forward. | loader | resolved | Discrete FSDP stages full source weights on CPU; unified-memory GPUs retain GPU-direct loading. Full FSDP+SP=2 inference passes without runtime DiT CPU offload. |

## Escape Hatches

No escape hatch is open. CI SSIM reference upload remains deliberately
unauthorized and is recorded as a quality-regression deferral, not a blocker to
local pipeline parity.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-07-11 | First public scope is Helios-Distilled T2V. | Keep a reviewable, verifiable variant. | Base/Mid, ODE, training and conditioned modes remain out of scope. |
| 2026-07-11 | Use Diffusers 0.39.0 as executable parity reference. | It matches the published Diffusers-layout checkpoint. | No conflicting Helios research requirements are installed. |
| 2026-07-11 | Preserve 1101 transformer keys directly. | Official and native key surfaces match. | No conversion script. |
| 2026-07-11 | Reuse Wan VAE and UMT5 only after exact-asset parity. | Architecture resemblance is insufficient. | Both reused components have non-skip evidence. |
| 2026-08-25 | Use a dedicated Helios pyramid stage inside `ComposedPipelineBase`. | Generic denoising cannot express AR history, three spatial levels and stage-local DMD. | One FastVideo architecture, model-specific stages only where required. |
| 2026-08-25 | Keep zero-init call fields but do not apply zero-star math for the pinned Distilled checkpoint. | Its model index declares `is_cfg_zero_star=false`; Diffusers also takes the standard CFG branch. | Signature stays compatible without claiming an inactive feature changes output. |
| 2026-08-25 | Move worker output to CPU before multiprocessing return. | Prevent CUDA IPC allocation after high-memory inference. | Public typed example is robust on 48 GB cards. |
| 2026-09-12 | Stage full checkpoint tensors on CPU for discrete-GPU FSDP loads. | GPU-direct source tensors and materialized FSDP shards otherwise peak together and exhaust 48 GB cards. | Runtime shards remain on GPU; unified-memory devices keep GPU-direct loading. |

## Handoff Notes

- Required components and pipeline parity are green on the integration branch.
- `quality_regression=deferred_with_reason`: local real-video integrity passes;
  publishing a CI reference needs separate approval.
- Repository-wide pre-commit and all Helios-specific gates are green. The
  current shared unit script has the five base-identical order-sensitive
  failures recorded in `I016`.
- Real 2-GPU FSDP+SP=2 inference passes with runtime DiT CPU offload disabled;
  the output is a valid 384×640, 33-frame H.264 video.
- No weights, generated media, reference clone, private report, token, push, or
  PR mutation is part of this state file.

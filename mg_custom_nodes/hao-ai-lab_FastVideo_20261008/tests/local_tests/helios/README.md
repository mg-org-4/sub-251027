# Helios Local Verification

Reviewer-facing setup and verification record for the native
`BestWishYsh/Helios-Distilled` text-to-video port. These tests compare FastVideo
against the exact Diffusers Helios implementation and require local assets for
non-skip author verification.

Port state and resolved issues live in
`tests/local_tests/helios/PORT_STATUS.md`.

The official T2V model index loads one `transformer`; `transformer_ode` is not
declared or used and remains outside this PR. Base/Mid, training, ODE, I2V, and
other variants are not supported by this first pipeline.

## Environment And Assets

Run from the FastVideo repository root:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

.venv/bin/python -c "from diffusers import AutoencoderKLWan, HeliosDMDScheduler, HeliosPyramidPipeline, HeliosTransformer3DModel; from transformers import AutoTokenizer, UMT5EncoderModel; print('imports ok')"
```

The verified environment uses Python 3.12.3, PyTorch `2.12.0+cu130`, CUDA 13,
Diffusers 0.39.0, Transformers 5.13.1, and `flash-attn==2.8.1`.

Download the pinned inference snapshot without the unused ODE transformer:

```bash
.venv/bin/python \
  .agents/skills/add-model-01-prep/scripts/download_hf_weights.py \
  BestWishYsh/Helios-Distilled \
  official_weights/helios \
  --revision 1999182614cb08d3bdcc46b9827504af2914b87b \
  --ignore-pattern "transformer_ode/*"
```

## FSDP + SP=2 Inference Regression

The distributed regression uses the production multiprocess `VideoGenerator`
path with both parallel modes active at once:

```python
generator = VideoGenerator.from_pretrained(
    "official_weights/helios",
    num_gpus=2,
    sp_size=2,
    use_fsdp_inference=True,
    dit_cpu_offload=False,
    dit_layerwise_offload=False,
    text_encoder_cpu_offload=True,
    vae_cpu_offload=True,
)
```

The managed 2026-09-12 run used two RTX 6000 Ada 48 GB GPUs, BF16 weights,
FlashAttention, 384×640, 33 frames, and pyramid steps `[2,2,2]`. It loaded the
14.31B transformer with CPU checkpoint staging and GPU-resident FSDP shards,
completed SP=2 communication warmup and all pipeline stages, then shut down
both workers normally.

```text

process result              normal_exit, exit code 0
full ffmpeg decode          pass
```

## End-To-End Latent Parity

Both implementations load the same checkpoint from scratch and use CPU seed
42, 128×192, 33 pixel frames, guidance 1.0, three `[2,2,2]` DMD stages,
history `[16,2,1]`, and nine latent frames per chunk.

```text
shape                    [1, 16, 9, 16, 24]
official abs mean        0.95911187
FastVideo abs mean       0.96272093
abs-mean relative drift  0.3763%
max absolute diff        1.89453125
mean absolute diff       0.17001711
RMSE                     0.24650776
cosine                   0.97970295
result                   PASS
```

Fixed gates are shape equality, cosine ≥0.95, abs-mean drift ≤5%, mean
absolute error ≤0.30, and RMSE ≤0.40. The managed current-head run completed in
82.85 seconds with one passed test and no skip.

## Typed Public Example

```bash
HELIOS_MODEL_PATH=official_weights/helios \
HELIOS_OUTPUT_PATH=outputs/helios/helios_distilled_t2v_384x640_33f.mp4 \
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" .venv/bin/python \
  examples/inference/basic/basic_helios_distilled_t2v.py
```

The example uses `VideoGenerator.from_config`, `GeneratorConfig`,
`GenerationRequest`, and typed sampling/output configs. The current-head run
completed generation in 29.43 seconds and produced:

```text
codec       H.264
resolution  640x384
fps         24
frames      33
duration    1.375 s
SHA-256     2e6d5099715256b16b865cb300479b328b2835f9f8792cb5427a98c17eb0b038
```

Full ffmpeg decode and the non-black-frame/container quality gate pass. The
contact sheet contains the requested fish, coral, and underwater scene.

Run the committed local quality gate with:

```bash
HELIOS_QUALITY_CANDIDATE=outputs/helios/helios_distilled_t2v_384x640_33f.mp4 \
  PYTHONPATH="$PWD" .venv/bin/pytest \
  tests/local_tests/helios/test_helios_quality_regression.py -v -s
```

Expected author result is one passed integrity test and one skipped reference
comparison. A CI SSIM reference is deliberately `deferred_with_reason`: its
publication requires separate upload approval, which this PR does not have.

## Review Notes

- Production code does not import Diffusers or Transformers model classes;
  those imports exist only in parity tests. The existing tokenizer boundary is
  reused.
- The dedicated pyramid stage is required by the official nine-frame
  autoregressive chunks, three spatial levels, history geometry, block-noise
  covariance, stage-local DMD schedules, and chunk decode contract.
- The discrete-GPU checkpoint-staging change in the shared loader is scoped to
  FSDP *inference*; FSDP training keeps its previous `cpu_offload`-only
  staging, so training runs are unaffected.
- `use_zero_init` and `zero_steps` remain in the public call surface for
  Diffusers signature compatibility. The pinned Distilled model declares
  `is_cfg_zero_star=false`, so both official and FastVideo standard-CFG paths
  intentionally ignore zero-star initialization for this checkpoint.
- Final decoded and latent outputs are moved to CPU inside the worker before
  multiprocessing return. A regression test prevents CUDA-IPC OOM from
  returning a GPU tensor while the 14.31B transformer remains resident.
- Generated media, tensor artifacts, weights, reference clones, and private
  reports remain ignored and must not be committed.

## Latest-Main Unit-Lane Baseline

The branch is rebased onto `a943220c`. In the current shared environment,
`.buildkite/scripts/unit_test.sh` reports `1315 passed, 9 skipped, 5 failed`.
The same five order-sensitive NVFP4/LoRA wiring failures reproduce on an
untouched `upstream/main@a943220c`; that test file passes independently with
`15 passed, 1 skipped` on both trees. Helios-specific gates and repository-wide
pre-commit pass.

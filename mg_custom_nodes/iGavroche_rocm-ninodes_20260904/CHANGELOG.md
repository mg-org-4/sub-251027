# Changelog

## [2.3.4] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **New `ROCmH3EasyCache` node** (`rocm_nodes/core/h3_easycache.py`, `rocm_nodes/nodes.py`, `rocm_nodes/core/__init__.py`): step-caching for 4-step MiniMax H3 workflows — V3 `io.ComfyNode` wrapping ComfyUI's core `EasyCache` with H3-tuned defaults (reuse_threshold 0.2, start 15%, end 95%, subsample_factor 8). Skips transformer calls when denoising delta is below threshold for ~25% speedup on fast H3 + Spectrum pipelines. Placed between loader/LoRA and sampler. Registered in `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `comfyui_manager.json` with category **ROCm Ninodes/Optimization**.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- **Brief fuzziness at temporal tile transitions in `ROCmVAEDecodeTiled` on LTX/WAN videos** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py`): the video path used ComfyUI's naive `decode_tiled` (`tiled_scale_multidim`), which resets the causal VAE state at every temporal tile boundary — producing a brief fuzzy moment at each transition (e.g. ~3s and near the end of an LTX 2.5 clip). It now uses the same causal-aware temporal tiling as `ROCmVAEDecode` (LTXVideo chunk boundary formula with the +1 causal-context frame, first-frame drop, and overlap blending against the cumulative result), so transitions are seamless. `_decode_video_temporal_tiled` was extracted to a shared module-level function used by `ROCmVAEDecode`, `ROCmVAEDecodeTiled`, and the legacy `ROCMOptimizedVAEDecodeTiled`.

### Added
- **`last_frame_fix` option on `ROCmVAEDecodeTiled`**: repeats the last latent frame before decode and trims the extra output frames, fixing end-of-video artifacts.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- **`to() received an invalid combination of arguments - got (NestedTensor)` crash in VAE decode** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py`, `rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCmVAEDecode`, `ROCmVAEDecodeTiled`, and the legacy `ROCMOptimizedVAEDecode`/`ROCMOptimizedVAEDecodeTiled` now unbind nested latents (`unbind()[0]`, the video stream) before decoding, matching stock ComfyUI `VAEDecode`. NestedTensors (MiniMax H3 / LTX-AV multimodal latents) cannot be passed to the VAE directly because its internal `.to(z)` calls fail.

- **`requires-comfyui = ">=1.0.0"` unsatisfiable** (`pyproject.toml`, `comfyui_manager.json`): ComfyUI versions are 0.x (e.g. 0.33.0), so `>=1.0.0` could never be satisfied and blocked installs via the new Manager. Lowered to `>=0.0.1`.

- **Missing `ROCMOptimizedVAEDecodeV2Phase3` node**: workflows saved with this legacy name failed to load. Added as an alias mapping to `ROCmVAEDecode` in `rocm_nodes/nodes.py`, `rocm_nodes.py`, and `comfyui_manager.json`.

- **Flux Benchmark crash** (`rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCmFluxBenchmark` hardcoded a 4-channel latent, which fails on Flux (`weight of size [512, 16, 3, 3], expected input[1, 4, 64, 64]`). Now reads the model's actual `latent_channels` (16 for Flux).

- **GGUF loader install/import failures** (`rocm_nodes/core/gguf_loader.py`, `install.py`, `requirements.txt`): removed the hardcoded Linux-only `ComfyUI-GGUF` path (cross-platform detection via `folder_paths.base_path`), guarded all module-level `gguf` usage so the node imports cleanly without the package, and made `install.py` auto-install `gguf`/`safetensors`.

- **~5x slower modern GGUF inference (Qwen Image etc.)** (`rocm_nodes/core/gguf_loader.py`): added GPU K-quant dequantization (Q2_K/Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K). These previously fell back to the slow CPU-side `gguf.quants.dequantize()` on every forward pass; now they dequantize on-device. Also removed the misleading "using fp32 precision" log line.

- **Legacy LoRA loader crash** (`rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCMLoRALoader` passed a file path string to `comfy.lora.load_lora`, causing `'str' object has no attribute 'keys'`. Now uses `load_torch_file` + `comfy.sd.load_lora_for_models` (matches stock `LoadLoRA`).

## [2.3.1] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **`'NestedTensor' object has no attribute 'reshape'` crash on LTXAV runs** (`rocm_nodes/core/sampler.py`): `ROCmSamplerCustomAdvanced` unconditionally re-unpacked the `x0` output whenever samples were nested. On multimodal runs (LTX audio-video) the sampler already hands the callback a `NestedTensor`, so the extra `unpack_latents()` called `.reshape()` on it and crashed after sampling completed. Now mirrors stock: unpack only when samples are nested but `x0` is not, then apply `process_latent_out`.

- **Incorrect memory estimate in video VAE decode** (`rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCmOptimizedVAEDecode`'s low-VRAM estimate multiplied a fixed 4-dimensional shape, undercounting 5D video latents. Now multiplies every sample dimension before applying the decode expansion factor.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **ROCm 7.14 support** (`rocm_nodes/utils/architecture.py`): Version detection (`detect_rocm_version`, `is_rocm_7_14_plus`) enables `allow_fp16_accumulation` on gfx1151 for ROCm 7.14+ (was blocked on older ROCm due to numerical drift). New `rocm_version` and `is_rocm_7_14_plus` keys in architecture info dict.

- **HIP OOM mitigation for APU temporal tiling** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py:727`, `rocm_nodes/utils/memory.py`): Added `discard_between_chunks()` — synchronized memory discard (sync+garbage collect+empty cache) between temporal VAE tiles. Added `del chunk_latent` immediately after decode to free input tensor backing pages. Together these prevent the HIP caching allocator from fragmenting on gfx1151 unified memory.

- **gfx1151-specific temporal chunk cap** (`rocm_nodes/constants.py`): `GFX1151_TEMPORAL_CHUNK_SIZE = 8` halves per-chunk memory pressure on APUs. Automatically caps user setting on gfx1151.

- **`TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT` advisory** (`architecture.py`): Logs a startup hint when the env var is not set on RDNA3/RDNA3.5 (AMD-recommended for LLM performance with PyTorch < 2.14).

- **TheRock build system + expandable segments diagnostics** (`utils/diagnostics.py`): Detects `/opt/rocm/core`, reports `expandable_segments` and `TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT` status.

### Changed
- **Naming consistency**: All node class names renamed from `ROCM*` prefix to `ROCm*` (e.g. `ROCMOptimizedVAEDecode` → `ROCmVAEDecode`). Old `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` keys preserved as backward-compatible aliases — existing workflows continue to load. Updated `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` to use consistent `ROCm` display prefix.

- **Registry configs updated** (`pyproject.toml`, `comfyui_manager.json`, `package.json`): Node lists updated to canonical names. Version bumped to `2.3.0` in all 8 locations.

- **Legacy deprecation**: `rocm_nodes.py` (2663-line monolithic file) deprecated with warning. The refactored `rocm_nodes/` package is the canonical source going forward.

### Fixed
- **No dynamic chunk sizing** (removed from `vae.py:720`): The OOM-mitigation strategy of dynamically reducing `c_end` mid-loop created undecoded latent frame gaps between tiles, causing visual ghosting/echo. Removed in favor of the safer approach: smaller default chunk size + aggressive `discard_between_chunks()`.

## [2.2.9] - 2025-06-28

### Fixed
- **Visible seams + extra frames in temporal VAE tiling** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py:673`): The overlap-blend step was blending each new chunk against the *truncated tail* of the previous chunk (`result_parts[-1]`) instead of the *cumulative* result tensor. After chunk 1 was shortened by `[1:]` to drop the first decoded frame, the next blend used that 24/32-frame tail as its reference, so `blend_frames` alternated 32 → 24 → 32 → 24 across chunks. This left a visible seam every two chunks in the back half of long videos and appended 8 extra frames per 2 chunks (1393 frames instead of 1201 for a 50 s LTX job). Blending is now done against the cumulative `result` tensor with `torch.cat` (which returns a fresh tensor), so the count is exact and seams disappear.

## [2.2.6] - 2025-06-15

### Fixed
- **ROCm sampler 2x slowdown on LTX 2.3 video** (`architecture.py:194`, `vae.py:272`): Removed `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = False` which unconditionally disabled TF32-accelerated GEMMs on AMD GPUs. This caused all matmuls to fall back to full fp32, hitting DiT-based models (LTX Video) hardest due to their matmul-heavy transformer architecture. TF32 is now left at its ROCm default (`True`), restoring stock performance.
- **Inconsistent backend settings**: VAE decode also duplicated the same `allow_tf32 = False` inline; now aligned to not set it.

## [2.0.10] - 2025-03-XX

### Changed
- **ROCm VAE Decode: Video chunking removed**: Video is always decoded in a single pass (no chunking).
  - Ensures correct behavior for all temporal/causal VAEs (WAN, LTX, and similar models).
  - Chunking broke the decoding chain and caused artifacts; full-video decode matches ComfyUI native behavior.
- **Removed parameters**: `video_chunk_size` and `memory_optimization_enabled` removed from the ROCm VAE Decode node (they only controlled chunking).

## [2.0.9] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- **LoRA Loader API Compatibility**: Fixed `load_lora() missing 1 required positional argument: 'to_load'` error
  - ComfyUI's `load_lora()` function now requires a `to_load` parameter specifying which components to load
  - Added automatic detection of model/clip presence to build `to_load` dictionary
  - Defaults to loading both model and clip if neither is explicitly provided
  - Fixes LoRA loading for all ComfyUI versions with the updated API

### Changed
- **LoRA Loader Output Messages**: Removed Unicode emojis from LoRA loader output
  - Replaced with ASCII prefixes: `[LOADING]`, `[INFO]`, `[SUCCESS]`, `[ERROR]`, `[WARNING]`
  - Improves Windows console compatibility and matches project style

## [2.0.8] - 2025-01-XX

### Changed
- **GGUF Loader UI Simplification**: Removed dtype selector from GGUF loader node
  - GGUF models are already quantized (Q8_0, Q4_0, etc.), so dtype selector was unnecessary
  - Simplified UI - only requires model file selection
  - Dtype is automatically set to fp32 (optimal for ROCm/gfx1151)

### Added
- **ROCm Optimizations for GGUF Loading**: Added comprehensive ROCm-specific optimizations
  - Automatic ROCm backend configuration (TF32 disabled, FP16 accumulation enabled)
  - gfx1151 architecture detection with automatic fp32 precision
  - Memory cleanup after loading large GGUF models using `simple_memory_cleanup()`
  - Non-blocking tensor transfers throughout dequantization pipeline
  - Optimized device transfers in `cast_bias_weight()`, `get_weight()`, and `dequantize_tensor()`

### Technical Details
- All `.to(device)` calls now use `non_blocking=True` for better GPU utilization
- ROCm backend settings configured before model loading for optimal performance
- Memory cleanup integrated to prevent fragmentation after large model loads
- Default dtype set to fp32 for gfx1151 architecture (better stability than fp16)

## [2.0.7] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Complete GGUF Dequantization Support**: Implemented full on-the-fly dequantization for GGUF models
  - Added dequantization functions for Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_1, Q5_0, Q5_1, and BF16 quantization types
  - Implemented `get_weight()` method that dequantizes tensors before PyTorch operations
  - Implemented `cast_bias_weight()` method for proper dtype/device casting with dequantization
  - Added `forward_comfy_cast_weights()` that routes to dequantization path for all ROCmGGMLTensor objects
  - Based on City96's ComfyUI-GGUF implementation, optimized for ROCm/gfx1151

### Fixed
- **GGUF Model Runtime Error**: Fixed "Multiple dispatch failed for torch.nn.linear" error
  - Issue occurred because ROCmGGMLTensor (custom tensor subclass) was being passed directly to PyTorch operations
  - Now all ROCmGGMLTensor objects (quantized and non-quantized) are properly converted to regular torch.Tensor before operations
  - Ensures F32/F16 tensors wrapped in ROCmGGMLTensor are also converted, not just quantized tensors
  - Fixes model loading and sampling for GGUF models (e.g., flux1-dev-Q8_0.gguf)

### Technical Details
- Added dequantization utility functions: `dequantize_tensor()`, `dequantize()`, and block-level dequantization functions
- Implemented lazy dequantization: tensors stay quantized in memory until needed during forward passes
- Added LoRA patch support in `get_weight()` for compatibility with ComfyUI's LoRA system
- Added VRAM estimation support via `ggml_save_to_state_dict()` for memory planning
- All ROCmGGMLTensor objects are now properly handled, ensuring PyTorch operations work correctly

  - Now checks multiple folder names: `diffusion_models`, `unet`, and `unet_gguf`
  - Combines ComfyUI's default file list with custom scanning for maximum compatibility
  - Supports all model formats: `.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.ckpt`, `.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin`, `.onnx`
- **PyTorch 2.0+ GGUF Loading**: Fixed `weights_only` error when loading GGUF files
  - PyTorch 2.0+ changed default `torch.load(weights_only=True)` which breaks GGUF files
  - Temporarily patches `torch.load` to set `weights_only=False` for GGUF files only
  - Restores original `torch.load` after loading to maintain security for other file types
- **Unicode Emoji Removal**: Removed all Unicode emojis from output messages
  - Replaced with ASCII alternatives: `[INFO]`, `[WARNING]`, `[ERROR]`, `[SUCCESS]`, `[CONFIG]`, `[LOADING]`, `[GPU]`, `[MEMORY]`
  - Improves Windows console compatibility and avoids encoding errors

### Technical Details
- Enhanced `_get_model_files()` to check multiple folder names and combine sources
- Added GGUF detection and PyTorch 2.0+ compatibility workaround

  - Previously only accepted `.safetensors` files
  - Now supports `.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.ckpt`, `.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin`, and `.onnx` formats
  - Custom file scanner replaces ComfyUI's default filter that was too restrictive
  - Issue reported by u/x5nder on Reddit - thank you for the bug report!

- Falls back to ComfyUI's default file list if custom scanning fails
- Updated documentation to reflect multi-format support

## [2.0.3] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- **KSampler Progress Reporting**: Fixed missing progress display in both UI and terminal
  - Progress bar now always shows in ComfyUI UI for both basic and advanced KSampler nodes
  - Terminal now displays step-by-step progress with detailed timing information
  - Fixed issue where `disable_pbar` parameter was preventing callback execution

- Maximum `video_chunk_size` increased to 200 for very long videos

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- **WAN VAE Video Jitter**: Fixed jitter/repeating frames issue in ROCm VAE Decode for WAN models
  - Added reliable WAN VAE detection using `isinstance()` check with imported WAN VAE classes
  - Added fallback detection using `latent_channels` (16 for WAN 2.1, 48 for WAN 2.2)
  - Disabled chunking for WAN VAEs to preserve causal decoding chain with feature caching
  - Matched native ComfyUI behavior exactly for WAN VAE video processing (full video decode)
  - Fixed detection logic to use correct file (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py` instead of `rocm_nodes.py`)

### Improved
- **ROCm Backend Optimizations**: Applied ROCm backend settings (TF32 disabled, FP16 accumulation enabled) to video processing
  - Backend optimizations now apply before video processing instead of only for image processing
  - Added async memory cleanup for WAN VAE videos (non-blocking, doesn't interfere with causal decoding)
  - Added gfx1151 architecture detection and logging for WAN VAE processing

### Technical Details
- WAN VAEs use causal decoding with feature caching - chunking breaks the cache and causes jitter on first frames
- Native ComfyUI processes WAN VAE videos in full (no chunking) - ROCm node now matches this behavior
- Detection uses multiple methods for reliability: `isinstance()` check, `latent_channels` check, and `temporal_compression_decode()` verification
- ROCm backend optimizations are global settings that improve performance without affecting causal decoding

## v2.0.0
- Samplers reset to stock behavior for correctness; added ROCm opt-in knobs:
  - optimize_for_video: disables preview/progress for multi-frame latents
  - precision_mode: auto|fp32|bf16 with ROCm bf16 safety guard (no forced cast yet)
  - compatibility_mode: forces pure stock behavior
- Advanced sampler made 1:1 with ComfyUI KSampler (Advanced) and categorized under "ROCm Ninodes/Sampling".
- Import structure stabilized; fallback to legacy `rocm_nodes.py` retained.
- Added SDPA preference via PyTorch native path (no CUDA-only toggles).
- Version bumped to 2.0.0 across `__init__.py`, `rocm_nodes/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`.
- Added workflow update helper script `scripts/update_workflows.py` to migrate node names.
- Docs updated to reflect v2 changes and toggles.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

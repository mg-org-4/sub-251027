# ROCm Ninodes: ROCm-Optimized Nodes for ComfyUI (v2.3.4)

**ROCm Ninodes** provides ComfyUI nodes tuned for AMD GPUs with ROCm (e.g. gfx1151 / Strix Halo): VAE decode, KSampler, checkpoint/diffusion/GGUF/LoRA loaders, **LTX2 prompt generation**, **SamplerCustomAdvanced drop-in**, and performance/memory monitoring. Install via ComfyUI Manager, `comfy node install rocm-ninodes`, or clone into `custom_nodes`.

## ⬆️ Upgrade to v2 (Required for existing users)

If you were on v1.x, run the upgrade script to clean legacy files and ensure the new package layout is detected by ComfyUI.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
uv run python tools/upgrade_to_v2.py
```

### Linux/Mac
```bash
uv run python tools/upgrade_to_v2.py
```

What it does:
- Backs up legacy `rocm_nodes.py` to `backup/rocm_nodes.py.bak` (if present)
- Removes any temporary `temp_*.py` files from earlier extractions
- Verifies `rocm_nodes/` package structure is intact
- Prints next steps (restart ComfyUI)

After running:
1) Restart ComfyUI completely
2) Verify nodes appear under "ROCm Ninodes" categories
3) If nodes don’t appear, clear ComfyUI cache and restart again

**ROCm Ninodes** is a custom node collection tuned for AMD GPUs with ROCm (especially gfx1151). It includes optimized VAE decode, KSampler, checkpoint/diffusion/GGUF/LoRA loaders, LTX2 prompt generation, SamplerCustomAdvanced drop-in, and monitoring nodes to maximize performance on AMD hardware with mature ROCm drivers.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.3.4

- **New `ROCmH3EasyCache` node** (`rocm_nodes/core/h3_easycache.py`): step-caching for 4-step MiniMax H3 workflows — wraps ComfyUI's core EasyCache with H3-tuned defaults (threshold 0.2, 15-95% range, subsample 8). Skips transformer calls when denoising change is below threshold for ~25% speedup on fast H3 + Spectrum pipelines. Category: **ROCm Ninodes/Optimization**.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.3.3

- **Fixed brief fuzziness at tile transitions in `ROCmVAEDecodeTiled` on LTX/WAN videos** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py`): the video path previously used ComfyUI's naive `decode_tiled` (tiled_scale_multidim), which resets the causal VAE state at every temporal tile boundary — causing a brief fuzzy moment at each transition (e.g. ~3s and near the end of an LTX 2.5 clip). It now uses the same causal-aware temporal tiling as `ROCmVAEDecode` (LTXVideo chunk boundary formula + overlap blending + first-frame drop), so tile transitions are seamless. Added a `last_frame_fix` option to fix end-of-video artifacts.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.3.2

- **Fixed `to() received an invalid combination of arguments - got (NestedTensor)` crash in VAE decode** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py`): `ROCmVAEDecode` / `ROCmVAEDecodeTiled` and the legacy `ROCMOptimizedVAEDecode` now unbind nested latents (`unbind()[0]`, the video stream) before decoding — matching stock ComfyUI `VAEDecode`. NestedTensors (MiniMax H3 / LTX-AV multimodal latents) can't be passed to the VAE directly because its internal `.to(z)` calls fail.
- **Fixed `requires-comfyui = ">=1.0.0"` unsatisfiable** (`pyproject.toml`, `comfyui_manager.json`): ComfyUI versions are 0.x (e.g. 0.33.0), so `>=1.0.0` could never be satisfied and blocked installs via the new Manager. Lowered to `>=0.0.1`.
- **Added missing `ROCMOptimizedVAEDecodeV2Phase3` node alias**: workflows saved with this legacy name now load (maps to `ROCmVAEDecode`).
- **Fixed Flux Benchmark crash** (`rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCmFluxBenchmark` now reads the model's actual `latent_channels` (16 for Flux) instead of hardcoding 4, so `Given groups=1, weight of size [512, 16, 3, 3], expected input[1, 4, 64, 64]` no longer occurs.
- **Fixed GGUF loader install/import failures** (`rocm_nodes/core/gguf_loader.py`, `install.py`, `requirements.txt`): removed the hardcoded Linux-only `ComfyUI-GGUF` path (cross-platform detection via `folder_paths.base_path`), guarded all module-level `gguf` usage so the node imports cleanly even without the package, and made `install.py` auto-install `gguf`/`safetensors`.
- **~5x faster Qwen Image / modern GGUF inference** (`rocm_nodes/core/gguf_loader.py`): added GPU K-quant dequantization (Q2_K/Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K). Previously these fell back to the slow CPU-side `gguf.quants.dequantize()` on every forward pass; now they dequantize on-device like City96's node. Also removed the misleading "using fp32 precision" log line.
- **Fixed legacy LoRA loader crash** (`rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCMLoRALoader` passed a file path string to `comfy.lora.load_lora`, causing `'str' object has no attribute 'keys'`. Now uses `load_torch_file` + `comfy.sd.load_lora_for_models` (matches stock `LoadLoRA`).

## 🚀 What's new in v2.3.1

- **Fixed `'NestedTensor' object has no attribute 'reshape'` crash on LTXAV runs** (`rocm_nodes/core/sampler.py`): `ROCmSamplerCustomAdvanced` unconditionally re-unpacked the `x0` output whenever the samples were nested. On multimodal runs (LTX audio-video) the sampler already hands the callback a `NestedTensor`, so the extra `unpack_latents()` called `.reshape()` on it and crashed after sampling. It now mirrors stock: only unpacks when the samples are nested but `x0` is not, then applies `process_latent_out` — so audio-video jobs denoise to the end without the AttributeError.
- **Fixed incorrect memory estimate in video VAE decode** (`rocm_nodes.py`): `ROCmOptimizedVAEDecode`'s low-VRAM estimate multiplied a fixed 4-dimensional shape, so 5D video latents massively undercounted the output size (batch × channels × T × H × W all collapsed). The estimate now multiplies every sample dimension before applying the decode expansion factor.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.9

- **Fixed visible seams + extra frames in temporal VAE tiling** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py:673`): The overlap-blend step was blending each new chunk against the *truncated tail* of the previous chunk (`result_parts[-1]`) instead of the *cumulative* result tensor. After chunk 1 was shortened by `[1:]` to drop the first decoded frame, the next blend used that 24/32-frame tail as its reference, so `blend_frames` alternated 32 → 24 → 32 → 24 across chunks. This left a visible seam every two chunks in the back half of long videos and appended 8 extra frames per 2 chunks (1393 frames instead of 1201 for a 50 s LTX job). Blending is now done against the cumulative `result` tensor with `torch.cat` (which returns a fresh tensor), so the count is exact and seams disappear.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.8

- **Fixed Windows access violation on LTX video decode** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py`): Removed the unconditional `comfy_has_chunked_io = False` override for LTX. Disabling chunked IO pushed ComfyUI's decode through `out.to(device=cpu, dtype=fp32, copy=True)`, a combined op that crashes on Windows with a `memmove` access violation under the ZLUDA/ROCm backend. LTX now uses the stock chunked path, which streams writes into a pre-allocated CPU buffer — no combined cast, lower GPU peak memory, no crash.
- **`enable_temporal_tiling` is now a 3-way combo** (`auto` / `enable` / `disable`, default `auto`): `auto` enables temporal tiling when the estimated decode output exceeds 3 GB, and logs a one-line recommendation when the output is long but still under the threshold. Explicit `enable` / `disable` are honored verbatim. Boolean `True` / `False` from old workflows are accepted and mapped to `enable` / `disable` for backward compatibility.
- **Visible previewer errors on Windows** (`rocm_nodes/core/sampler.py`): the three ROCm sampler callbacks used to swallow the previewer's `decode_latent_to_preview_image` exception silently, which is why LTX video previews appeared to vanish on Windows (the `taeltx_2` TAESD previewer hit the same ZLUDA crash internally). The exception type and message are now logged once per failed step.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.7

- **Fixed Windows access violation in temporal VAE tiling** (`rocm_nodes/core/vae.py:700`): The overlap-blend step was using in-place slice assignment (`result_parts[-1][-blend_frames:] = ...`), which triggers a fatal access violation on Windows under the ZLUDA/ROCm backend. The blend is now built with pure tensor arithmetic and `torch.cat`, then the list entry is replaced — no in-place write into a strided slice, so long LTX/WAN videos decode cleanly on Windows + AMD.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.6

- **Fixed severe ROCm sampler slowdown on LTX 2.3 video** (`architecture.py`, `vae.py`): Removed `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = False` which unconditionally disabled TF32-accelerated matrix multiplications on AMD GPUs. This forced all matmuls to fp32 precision, making DiT-based models like LTX Video ~2x slower. TF32 is now left at its ROCm default (`True`), restoring stock performance while keeping all other ROCm optimizations.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.5

- **Fixed illegal memory access on LTX-2.3-22b** (`architecture.py`): `allow_fp16_accumulation=True` is now skipped for RDNA 3.5 (gfx1151 / Strix Halo). This global matmul setting caused numerical drift and `hipErrorIllegalAddress` crashes in bf16 flow-matching models (LTX Video). Other AMD architectures (RDNA 2/3, CDNA) still enable it for performance.
- **ROCm backend settings applied** (`sampler.py`): `ROCMSamplerCustomAdvanced` now calls `apply_rocm_backend_settings()` and runs `emergency_memory_cleanup()` for high-memory models (factor > 5x) — consistent with the other ROCm samplers.
- **VRAM safety check**: Warns before sampling if < 2GB free or > 95% VRAM used, with actionable suggestions (disable CacheDiT, remove `--reserve-vram`, reduce frame count).
- **Flash attention override**: New advanced `flash_attention` parameter (`auto` / `disable_flash` / `force_flash`) allows toggling PyTorch SDP backends per-node. `force_flash` prefers flash but keeps math/efficient as fallback.
- **Model architecture detection**: `detect_model_sampling_type()` now returns `model_architecture` field (`"ltx"`, `"flux"`, `"wan"`, `"sd"`, `"unknown"`) for better diagnostic logging.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.4

- **Cancel responsiveness**: `ROCMSamplerCustomAdvanced` callback and `ROCM VAE Decode` tiling loops now call `model_management.throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted()` each step/chunk — pressing Cancel stops generation immediately instead of waiting for the current operation to finish.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.3

- **Fixed GPU crash on large models** (sampler): Removed `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32=False` and all `emergency_memory_cleanup()` calls from `ROCMSamplerCustomAdvanced`. The TF32 flag is NVIDIA-specific and could trigger `hipErrorLaunchFailure` on ROCm 7.13 with 46GB+ models. Node now only adds logging and the enhanced callback — zero global torch state changes.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.2

- **Fixed dark vertical bands** (sampler): Removed `allow_fp16_accumulation=True` which caused numerical drift in bf16 flow-matching models (LTX), producing banding artifacts.
- **Fixed first-frame oversaturation** (VAE): Causal video VAEs (LTX) now keep model weights in native precision. Input tensors are still fp16 for memory efficiency, but the causal state no longer accumulates fp16 errors from frame 0.
- **Clean interface**: Removed `optimize_for_video` and `precision_mode` params. Video auto-detected from latent shape. Only `compatibility_mode` remains as an advanced debug toggle.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.1

- **Callback perf fix**: Previewer created once (not every 5 steps), console timing at 10% milestones only — eliminates I/O overhead during sampling.
- **Clean interface**: Removed `optimize_for_video` and `precision_mode` noise parameters. Video is auto-detected from latent shape. Only `compatibility_mode` remains as an advanced toggle.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.2.0

- **ROCm SamplerCustomAdvanced** (`rocm_nodes/core/sampler.py`): Drop-in replacement for ComfyUI's V3 `SamplerCustomAdvanced` using the new `define_schema()` API. Preserves the exact same interface (noise, guider, sampler, sigmas, latent_image) while adding architecture-aware ROCm backend tuning, emergency memory defrag for high-memory models (LTX 128ch latents), enhanced per-step callback with ETA, and optional video-workflow mode. Category: **ROCm Ninodes → Sampling**.
- **ROCm SamplerCustomAdvanced Benchmark**: A/B comparison node that runs stock then ROCm-optimized on identical inputs, reporting timing, peak memory, speedup, and model info. Category: **ROCm Ninodes → Sampling**.
- **Precision management**: `precision_mode` (auto|fp32|bf16) and `compatibility_mode` toggle for the new custom sampler node.
- **Full documentation**: `docs/SAMPLER_CUSTOM_ADVANCED.md` covers implementation details, input/output reference, and usage for both agents and users.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.1.1

- **ROCm KSampler auto-detection**: Sampler now detects GPU architecture and model type automatically. No new toggles.
  - Flow-matching models (z-image, z-image-turbo, ernie, ideogram4) detected and logged
  - Pixel-space models (z-image-turbo) recognized — no VAE decode needed downstream
  - High-memory models (ideogram4, factor 11.6x) get automatic memory cleanup before/after sampling
  - Architecture-aware backend settings: `allow_tf32=False`, `allow_fp16_accumulation=True`
- **Shared architecture detection**: GPU architecture detection (`detect_architecture()`) extracted to shared module used by both VAE decode and KSampler.
- **Updated Sampler Performance Monitor**: Architecture-aware and model-type-aware recommendations.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.1.0

- **LTX Video VAE support**: Full support for Lightricks LTX VideoVAE (128 channels, 32× spatial compression). Automatic detection, fp16 optimized, full-video causal decode.
- **z-image / z-image-turbo passthrough**: Pixel-space VAEs (latent_channels=3, spatial_compression=1) detected automatically and processed as passthrough — no VAE decode needed.
- **fp16 default on AMD**: VAE decode defaults to fp16 on all AMD GPUs (Strix Halo, RDNA 2/3, CDNA). Doubles memory efficiency for large-channel VAEs.
- **Per-architecture tuning**: Automatic GPU architecture detection (gfx1151, gfx1100, gfx1030, CDNA) with per-arch tile sizes, precision, and batch caps.
- **Temporal tiling for long videos** (optional, disabled by default): Decode long LTX/WAN videos in temporal chunks with overlap to prevent OOM. See "ROCm VAE Decode" settings for `enable_temporal_tiling`.
- **Chunked IO bypass for LTX**: Disables giant pre-allocation for LTX VideoVAE, fixing crashes with `PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb`.
- **Fixed memory estimation**: Correctly accounts for all tensor dimensions (including temporal for 5D) and actual dtype size.
- **Memory estimation for APU**: Strix Halo unified memory now uses `psutil` for system-wide available RAM.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.0.11

- **ROCm Text Generate LTX2 Prompt**: Drop-in replacement for ComfyUI's TextGenerateLTX2Prompt — same inputs (clip, prompt, max_length, optional image, sampling params) and output. Tuned for ROCm/gfx1151 with device and memory handling; for best speed run ComfyUI with `--use-pytorch-attention`. Category: **ROCm Ninodes → Generative AI**.
- **Generative AI category**: LTX2 prompt node appears under **ROCm Ninodes / Generative AI**.

## 🚀 What's new in v2.0.10

- **Checkpoint cache**: ROCm Checkpoint Loader caches the last loaded checkpoint by name; repeat runs with the same checkpoint skip reload (saves time and avoids extra VRAM churn). Use **use_cache** (default on) and **force_reload** when you need a fresh load.
- **FP8 / quantized checkpoint reuse**: Fixed "Cannot set version_counter for inference tensor" when reusing a cached checkpoint that uses MixedPrecisionOps (e.g. LTX FP8 text encoder). Requires the corresponding fix in ComfyUI's `comfy/ops.py` (QuantizedTensor handling in `_apply`).

## 🚀 What's new in v2.0.1

- **WAN VAE Video Fix**: Fixed jitter/repeating frames issue for WAN models
  - Automatic WAN VAE detection with multiple fallback methods
  - Disabled chunking for WAN VAEs to preserve causal decoding chain
  - Matches native ComfyUI behavior exactly for WAN video processing

  - `precision_mode` (auto|fp32|bf16) with ROCm bf16 safety guard
  - `compatibility_mode` to force pure stock behavior
- Advanced sampler is a 1:1 copy of ComfyUI's KSampler (Advanced), just categorized under `ROCm Ninodes/Sampling`.

## 📖 Node Usage Guide

### Core Nodes

#### 🖼️ **ROCm VAE Decode**
**Location**: `ROCm Ninodes/VAE` → `ROCm VAE Decode`

**Purpose**: Optimized VAE decoding for AMD GPUs with ROCm support. Detects VAE type automatically and applies optimal settings for standard, WAN, LTX Video, and pixel-space (z-image) VAEs.

**How to Use**:
1. Connect your `LATENT` output from a sampler to the `samples` input
2. Connect your `VAE` model to the `vae` input
3. Use default settings for most cases

**Key Settings**:
- **tile_size**: 768-2048 depending on architecture (default: 768)
- **overlap**: 96-128 for good quality (default: 96)
- **precision_mode**: "auto" selects optimal precision (fp16 default on AMD)
- **Video (WAN, LTX)**: Decoded in one pass with causal preservation. fp16 used for memory efficiency.

**LTX Video-specific**:
- Latent channels: 128 (automatically detected)
- Spatial compression: 32× (tile sizes auto-scaled with 64px latent minimum)
- Enabled full-video causal decode; chunked IO disabled to avoid pre-allocation OOM
- **Temporal tiling** (optional, disabled by default): For very long videos (>200 frames). Decodes in overlapping temporal chunks with linear blending — no frame loss, no visible seams. Progress bar shown during decode.

**Recommended temporal tiling settings for long LTX videos:**
```
enable_temporal_tiling=True
temporal_chunk_size=16    # Latent frames per chunk (~121 output frames each)
temporal_overlap=2        # Latent frames overlap (blended for smooth transition)
last_frame_fix=True       # Prevents end-of-video artifacts
```

How temporal tiling works:
- Video is split into overlapping chunks along the temporal axis
- Each chunk is decoded independently (memory per chunk ~chunk_size, not full video)
- The first output frame of each chunk is dropped (incomplete temporal context)
- The next `temporal_overlap × temporal_comp` frames are linearly blended with the previous chunk's tail for a seamless transition
- Result: **exact same frame count** as a full decode — zero frame loss

**Pixel-space (z-image / z-image-turbo)**:
- Detected automatically (latent_channels=3, compression=1)
- Passthrough decode — no VAE model loaded or dtype converted

**Output**: `IMAGE` - Decoded image tensor ready for saving or further processing

---

#### 🎨 **ROCm VAE Decode Tiled**
**Location**: `ROCm Ninodes/VAE` → `ROCm VAE Decode Tiled`

**Purpose**: Advanced tiled VAE decode for very large images or video with temporal support.

**How to Use**:
1. Connect `LATENT` to `samples` input
2. Connect `VAE` model to `vae` input
3. Use for images >1024x1024 or when you need temporal control for video
4. Adjust `temporal_size` and `temporal_overlap` for video workflows

**Key Settings**:
- **tile_size**: 768-1024 (default: 768)
- **temporal_size**: 64 frames for video (default: 64)
- **temporal_overlap**: 8 frames overlap for video (default: 8)

**Output**: `IMAGE` - Decoded image/video tensor

---

#### 🎲 **ROCm KSampler**
**Location**: `ROCm Ninodes/Sampling` → `ROCm KSampler`

**Purpose**: Optimized KSampler with ROCm-specific optimizations and progress reporting. **Auto-detects GPU architecture and model type** — no manual configuration needed.

**How to Use**:
1. Connect your `MODEL` to `model` input
2. Connect `CONDITIONING` (positive and negative) from your CLIP text encode nodes
3. Connect `LATENT` image (usually from Empty Latent Image node)
4. Set your desired `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, and `scheduler`
5. Connect the output `LATENT` to your VAE Decode node

**Key Settings**:
- **steps**: 20-30 for most cases
- **cfg**: 7.0-8.0 for gfx1151 (default: 8.0)
- **sampler_name**: Euler, Heun, or dpmpp_2m work well with ROCm
- **optimize_for_video**: Enable for multi-frame latents (disables previews)
- **precision_mode**: "auto" selects optimal precision (fp16 on AMD, fp32 on CPU)

**Auto-detection** (no toggles needed):
- **Architecture**: Detects gfx1151/gfx1100 (fp16), gfx942 (bf16) — applies backend settings automatically
- **Flow-matching** (z-image, ernie, ideogram4): Logged and handled optimally
- **Pixel-space** (z-image-turbo): Recognized — no VAE decode needed downstream
- **High-memory** (ideogram4): Automatic `emergency_memory_cleanup` before sampling

**Output**: `LATENT` - Sampled latent tensor (connect to VAE Decode)

**Progress**: Shows real-time progress in both UI and terminal with step-by-step information

### 🔗 Connecting Performance Nodes to Outputs

All performance monitoring nodes output **STRING** values that need to be connected to **Show Text** nodes to be visible in ComfyUI.

#### Step-by-Step: Adding Performance Monitoring to Your Workflow

1. **Add the performance node** (e.g., `ROCm VAE Performance Monitor`)
2. **Connect the required inputs** (e.g., `VAE` model)
3. **Add Show Text nodes** for each output:
   - Right-click → Add Node → **Show Text** (or search for "Show Text")
   - You'll need one Show Text node per output
4. **Connect the outputs**:
   - Drag from the performance node's output to the Show Text node's `text` input
5. **Run your workflow** - the text will appear in the UI showing the results

#### Example: Complete VAE Performance Monitor Setup

```
[VAE Model] 
    ↓

### 🔧 **Advanced Windows Troubleshooting**

#### **Memory Issues on Windows:**
```powershell
# Check available memory
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PhysicalMemory | Measure-Object -Property Capacity -Sum

# Set additional memory management
$env:PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF = "expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:512"
```

#### **ROCm Installation Issues:**
```powershell
# Verify ROCm installation
rocm-smi

# Check PyTorch ROCm support
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.version.hip)"
```

#### **Git Issues on Windows:**
```powershell
# Fix line ending issues
git config --global core.autocrlf true

# Reset repository if corrupted
cd custom_nodes
rmdir /s ComfyUI-ROCM-Optimized-VAE
git clone https://github.com/iGavroche/rocm-ninodes.git ComfyUI-ROCM-Optimized-VAE
```

### If you experience issues:
1. Check the Performance Monitor node for recommendations
2. Try reducing tile size if you get OOM errors
3. Ensure you're using ROCm-compatible PyTorch
4. Check that "use_rocm_optimizations" is enabled

### ROCm Requirements:
- PyTorch with ROCm support (nightly build recommended)
- ROCm 6.4+ (you're using 6.4)

### uv-Specific Issues

#### 🐧 **Linux (Manjaro/Ubuntu/etc.)**

1. **uv not found after installation**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Virtual environment not activating**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the ComfyUI directory
   cd ComfyUI
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **PyTorch ROCm installation fails**:
   ```bash
   # Clear uv cache and retry
   uv cache clean
   uv pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/ --pre torch torchaudio torchvision --upgrade
   ```

4. **Permission issues with uv**:
   ```bash
   # Install uv for current user only
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

#### 🪟 **Windows (PowerShell)**

1. **uv not found after installation**:
   ```powershell
   # Add uv to PATH or use full path
   $env:PATH += ";C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.cargo\bin"
   # Or restart PowerShell after installation
   ```

2. **Virtual environment not activating**:
   ```powershell
   # Make sure you're in the ComfyUI directory
   cd ComfyUI
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **PowerShell execution policy**:
   ```powershell
   # If you get execution policy errors
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   git clone https://github.com/iGavroche/rocm-ninodes.git ComfyUI-ROCM-Optimized-VAE
   ```

7. **Virtual environment activation fails**:
   ```powershell
   # Make sure you're in the ComfyUI directory (not custom_nodes)
   cd C:\ComfyUI
   
   # Try activating the virtual environment
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # If that fails, try this alternative
   & ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
   ```

### Windows-Specific Issues

1. **ROCm not working on Windows**: 
   - ROCm has limited Windows support
   - Consider using WSL2 with Ubuntu for better compatibility
   - Or dual-boot Linux for optimal performance

2. **PowerShell execution policy**:
   ```powershell
   # If you get execution policy errors
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

3. **Python path issues**:
   ```powershell
   # Make sure Python is in your PATH
   python --version
   # If not found, add Python to PATH or use full path
   ```

4. **Git not found**:
   - Install Git for Windows from https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Or use GitHub Desktop for GUI-based cloning

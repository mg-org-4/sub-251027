# ComfyUI-OpenCut

**[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)**

A powerful, privacy-focused video editor integrated directly into ComfyUI. This plugin brings professional video editing capabilities to your ComfyUI workflow without any server-side processing.

## 🆕 What's New in v0.4.0

This release rebases the embedded OpenCut onto upstream `main` after ~8 months
of heavy development (≈364 commits since the v0.3.0 build on 2025-08-30).
The highlights below are from the OpenCut project itself — they apply to
the editor running inside this plugin as well.

### Rendering engine — WebGL ➜ Rust/WASM GPU renderer
- New GPU renderer migrated from WebGL to wgpu compiled to WASM (with a
  WebGL fallback while WebGPU support stabilizes in browsers).
- Time, effects, and mask logic split into dedicated Rust crates
  (`opencut-wasm`) — shared between web and the new desktop build.
- Batched GPU command encoding, degraded-renderer banner, and graceful
  handling when no GPU is available.

### Keyframes & animation
- Rewritten animation system using scalar-channel bindings.
- **Graph editor** for flat keyframe segments — a new popover lets you
  edit multiple properties at once.
- **Expandable keyframe lanes** directly in the timeline.
- Keyframes now wired for opacity, text color, every background property,
  and per-axis position animation.
- Clipboard-level keyframe paste.

### Effects & masks
- New WebGL effects system — starts with a Blur effect and per-clip
  effect stacking with asset sorting.
- Cinematic bars, diamond, heart, star, and **custom/text masks**,
  with stable background-blur previews.

### Timeline & editor UX
- Move/resize/split/delete **multiple elements** at once.
- Clip volume line visualized directly in the timeline.
- Waveform rendering improvements and correct audio waveform height.
- Timeline auto-scroll while dragging clips.
- Copy/paste for elements; ripple support for element resize.
- Select-on-insert; centralized selection management.
- New preview overlay system (guides, bookmark notes).

### App surface
- **Desktop app** scaffolding (Tauri) introduced.
- Changelog page with markdown + technical-detail support; "new release"
  notice.
- Branding page; mobile-gate screen; history view in the feedback popover.
- Audio separated from elements (export now handles audio consistently).
- Migration system rewritten (`run()` + pure v1→v2 transforms) with new
  storage-schema migrations.

### Under the hood
- File tree restructured into domain modules (`editor/`, `timeline/`,
  `preview/`, `project/`, `media/`, etc.) with a cleaner dependency graph.
- Time utilities migrated from TypeScript to Rust WASM.
- Unified element-update pipeline and centralized ripple handling.

### Plugin-side fixes in this build
- All assets and routes honor the `/opencut` basePath (logo, landing
  image, country flags, effect previews, PWA manifest).
- RSC prefetch URLs served by the Python handler now cover Next.js 16's
  dot-separated `__next.<seg>.__PAGE__.txt` format.
- `getEditorUrl` / `getProjectsUrl` no longer double-prefix basePath
  when passed to `<Link>`.
- Sounds-search and other removed server routes are gracefully skipped
  in ComfyUI mode.
- Save timer no longer throws after closing a project.

See `docs/COMFYUI_INTEGRATION.md` and `docs/COMFYUI_BUILD_CHECKLIST.md`
in the OpenCut repo for adaptation details and future rebase guidance.

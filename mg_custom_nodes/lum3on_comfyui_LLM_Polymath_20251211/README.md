## Updates

The Polymath Chat Node and the LLM Settings now support the latest image generating model from OpenAI ‘gpt-image-1’. However, you need a verified OpenAI account to use it.

# LLM Polymath Chat Node
An advanced Chat Node for ComfyUI that integrates large language models to build text-driven applications and automate data processes (RAGs), enhancing prompt responses by optionally incorporating real-time web search, linked content extraction, and custom agent instructions. It supports both OpenAI’s GPT-like models and alternative models served via a local Ollama API. At its core, two essential instructions—the Comfy Node Finder, which retrieves relevant custom nodes from a the ComfyUi- Manager Custom-node-JSON database based on your queries, and the Smart Assistant, which ingests your workflow JSON to deliver tailored, actionable recommendations—drive its powerful, context-aware functionality. Additionally, a range of other agents such as Flux Prompter, several Custom Instructors, a Python debugger and scripter, and many more further extend its capabilities.

## Features

### Prompt Processing
- **Placeholder Replacement:** If your prompt contains the placeholder `{additional_text}`, the node replaces it with the provided additional text. Otherwise, any additional text is appended.
- **Dynamic Augmentation:** Depending on the settings, the node can automatically augment your prompt with web-fetched content or search results.

### Web Search Integration
- **URL Extraction:** Scans the input prompt for URLs and uses BeautifulSoup to extract text from the linked pages.
- **Google Search Results:** If enabled, it performs a Google search for your query, retrieves a specified number of results (controlled via `num_search_results`), and appends the extracted content to the prompt.
- **Source Listing:** Optionally appends all fetched sources to the prompt so that the language model’s response can reference them.

### Model & API Integration
- **Model Loading:** Loads model configurations from a local `config.json` file and fetches additional models from an Ollama API endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags`).
- **API Selection:**  
  - The model automatically selects the API depending on which model is selected from the list. The polymath currently supports Grok, Gemini, Gemma, Deepseek, and Claude.
  - If Ollama is installed and running, the node uses the Ollama API.
- **Chat History:** Optionally retains context from previous interactions to allow for more natural, continuous conversations.

### Custom Instructions
- **Instruction Files:** The node scans a `custom_instructions` directory for `.txt` files and makes them available as options.  
- **Node Finder Specialization:** If the custom instruction named “node finder” is selected, the node loads and appends information from a JSON file (`custom-node-list.json`) to aid in finding specific nodes.

### Image Handling
- **Image Conversion:** Converts provided image tensors into PIL images and encodes them as base64 strings. These are then included in the payload sent to the language model, enabling multimodal interactions.

### Logging & Debugging
- **Console Logging:** When enabled (`Console_log`), detailed information about the prompt augmentation process and API calls is printed to the console.
- **Seed Control:** Uses a user-provided seed to help manage randomness and reproducibility.

### Output Compression
- **Compression Options:** If compression is enabled, the node appends a directive to the prompt that instructs the model to produce concise output. Three levels are available:
  - **Soft:** Maximum output size ~250 characters.
  - **Medium:** Maximum output size ~150 characters.
  - **Hard:** Maximum output size ~75 characters.

## Ollama Installation & Model Download

OLLAMA (Ollama) enables you to run large language models locally with a few simple commands. Follow these instructions to install OLLAMA and download models.

### Installing OLLAMA

#### On macOS:
Download the installer from the official website or install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ollama
```

#### On Linux:
Run the installation script directly from your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### On Windows:
Visit the [Ollama Download Page](https://ollama.com/download) and run the provided installer.

### Downloading Models

Once OLLAMA is installed, you can easily pull and run models. For example, to download the lightweight Gemma 2B model:

```bash
ollama pull gemma:2b
```

After downloading, you can start interacting with the model using:

```bash
ollama run gemma:2b
```

For a full list of available models (including various sizes and specialized variants), please visit the official [Ollama Model Library](https://ollama.com/library).

### Model Availability in Comfy

After you download a model via Ollama, it will automatically be listed in the model dropdown in Comfy after you restart it. This seamless integration means you don’t need to perform any additional configuration—the model is ready for use immediately within Comfy.

### Example Workflow

1. **Install OLLAMA** on your system using the method appropriate for your operating system.
2. **Download a Model** with the `ollama pull` command or use the run command and the model gets auto downloaded.
3. **Run the Model** with `ollama run <model-name>` to start a REPL and interact with it.
4. **Keep the Cli open** so that Comfy can acess the local Olama api
5. **Restart Comfy** to have the downloaded model automatically appear in the model dropdown for easy selection.

By following these steps, you can quickly set up OLLAMA on your machine and begin experimenting with different large language models locally.

For further details on model customization and advanced usage, refer to the official documentation at [Ollama Docs](https://docs.ollama.com).

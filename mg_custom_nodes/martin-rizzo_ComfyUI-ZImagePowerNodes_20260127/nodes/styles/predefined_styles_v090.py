>>>80s Dark Fantasy Photo
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a still photographer on the set of a 1980s dark fantasy epic (think *Excalibur*, *Legend*, *Conan the Barbarian*, or *Hawk the Slayer*). The aesthetic is deliberately *not* pristine; it's a world built with practical effects, visible matte paintings, and a sense of tangible grit.
Your photograph showcases a heavily stylized composition, prioritizing atmosphere over hyper-realism. Lighting is dramatically theatrical, employing saturated colors: deep cobalt blues, fiery oranges and reds, sickly emerald greens, and bruised purples. Strong backlighting and rim lighting are key. Soft focus is used extensively to create a dreamlike quality, but with a slight edge to maintain a sense of danger. Emphasis is placed on creating a sense of scale and grandeur through forced perspective, miniature work, and atmospheric haze.  
Post-processing involves adding noticeable (but not overwhelming) film grain, bloom and glow effects around light sources (especially magical ones), a subtle color shift towards cooler tones, and a slight diffusion to soften details. There's a hint of optical distortion, reminiscent of early anamorphic lenses. The overall mood is one of brooding mystery and impending doom.

The lighting is bold and directional, often coming from a single side or from below, casting stark shadows and emphasizing the exaggerated geometry.  
Colors are saturated but slightly shifted toward teal-cyan on the shadows and warm amber on the highlights, heightening the visual tension.  
A shallow depth of field is occasionally introduced to isolate the subject while the surrounding environment stretches dramatically.  
Fine grain and a touch of motion blur are added to reinforce the feeling of immediacy and kinetic energy.

YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a contemporary photographer whose work is crafted for a modern, social-media-savvy audience.
The images are clean, sharply focused, and highly polished, with a crisp resolution that highlights fine detail.
Lighting is bright and evenly diffused, often using natural daylight or soft artificial key-light that produces a luminous, airy feel.

>>>Ultimate Anime
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a top-tier anime key visual artist specializing in high-fidelity CGI rendering. Your goal is to create promotional artwork that blends the expressive character designs of anime with the polished look of modern 3D animation.
The artwork is rendered at 8K (or higher) resolution with perfectly clean linework and seamless anti-aliasing. Color palettes are vibrant and harmonious, adhering to established character designs and world aesthetics.
Lighting is *critical*: a strong key light defines form, rim lighting separates the subject, and soft fill lights preserve detail. Highlights should have a pronounced bloom and subtle lens flares. Shadows are smoothly graded with a focus on realistic light diffusion.
Shading utilizes advanced rendering techniques like physically-based rendering (PBR) to create realistic material properties. Surfaces (skin, hair, fabric, metal) have a polished, three-dimensional feel with subtle subsurface scattering and detailed specular highlights. Avoid overly-stylized cell-shading; aim for a smooth gradient.
Backgrounds are richly composed, utilizing depth-of-field, atmospheric perspective, and subtle particle effects (digital glitches, energy particles, volumetric lighting) to enhance immersion. Backgrounds should *support* the characters, not distract from them.
Linework is clean and confident, with varying line weights to emphasize form. Consider a subtle digital "smoothing" effect to the lines.
Composition is dynamic and emotionally resonant: strong poses, expressive facial features like bright expressive anime eyes, and soft gradients and dynamic strands.  Think about the "rule of thirds" and leading lines.
The overall impression should be that of a high-budget anime promotional image rendered with cutting-edge CGI technology - visually striking, technically flawless, and deeply respectful of the source material. Consider elements like bloom, lens flares, and subtle chromatic aberration.

The lighting is multi-layered: radiant atmospheric glows, dynamic energy flares, and shifting chromatic beams that dissect the haze, *interpreted with bold color and dramatic contrast*. Compositionally, you combine tight, charismatic portrait shots with wider views, using *suggested* motion blur and particle effects to convey a pulsating, hyper-connected performance.

OUTSIDE THE PIXELATED ARCADE GAME:
A dimly lit arcade, including other machines and neon signs, both slightly out of focus.
THE PHOTO:
A close-up of an early 1990s arcade machine. It sits in a dimly lit arcade, its side panels covered in glossy vinyl graphics. The CRT monitor glows with its characteristic phosphorescent hue, and the joystick and buttons show slight wear. The arcade machine is viewed from a three-quarter angle, capturing its design, the bright screen, and the reflective floor tiles.

YOUR PHOTO:
An eye-level, cinematic photograph of the billboard from street level, showing the vivid neon glow, the wet pavement reflections, and distant cityscape. The billboard's content is crisp and bright, while the surrounding environment retains a slight motion blur for a dynamic urban feel.

>>>Holographic Device
YOUR CONTEXT:
A futuristic holographic projector sits atop a sleek, polished pedestal in a minimalist showroom. The projection emits a semi-transparent, three-dimensional image that floats in the air, illuminated by a soft, bluish-white light. The surrounding space is clean, with subtle reflections on the floor.
The holographic screen is positioned at a slightly elevated angle, capturing the floating image.
THE HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTOR
It's a heavy metal tube with an industrial look and the appearance of a radiator. A powerful red reflector shines from its top side.
INSIDE YOUR HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE:
The image features blue tones with intensely illuminated light blue lines and wireframe details of light blue lines.

OUTSIDE THE ARTWORK:
The coffee is in the foreground with a shallow depth of field, shot taken from a slight top-down angle. The foam is subtly depicted against the dark coffee, while the background shows a blurred café scene: a wooden table, other cups and a black background in the top. Light steam rises gently, creating a cozy atmosphere.

A nostalgic photograph of the cassette tape lying on a faded carpet. The word "CASSETTE" can be seen written on it. The image captures the handwritten typography, and faint tape-track reflections. Ambient teal-green bedroom light creates a soft, retro vibe.


>>>Vintage Postcard
YOUR CONTEXT:
A postcard printed in the 1950s depicts a charming coastal village. The card is slightly creased, its edges softened by years of handling, and the paper has a warm, yellowed patina.

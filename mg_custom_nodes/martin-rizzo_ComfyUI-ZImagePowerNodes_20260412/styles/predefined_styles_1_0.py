>>>Low Quality Photo
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are creating images in the style of a disposable camera, capturing everyday life with a deliberately cheap and lo-fi aesthetic.
The images should reflect the limitations of the technology: very soft focus, and noticeable color shifting.  Lighting is uneven, creating high contrast with deep, greenish-dark shadows and blown-out, reddish highlights.
Colors are vibrant but inaccurate - expect bluish tints and unnatural, greenish skin tones.  Include heavy motion blur, light halos, and other imperfections. Subjects often appear silhouetted against bright backgrounds.
Composition is informal and poorly framed, aiming for a raw, immediate, and unpolished feel. The overall impression should be amateurish and low-quality.

>>>Dramatic Dark Lighting
YOUR CONTEXT:

Your photographs utilize a powerful rim light from directly behind the subject, creating a bright, almost ethereal halo effect and emphasizing their outline. The subject is intentionally underexposed, appearing as a dark, mysterious form against a deeply shadowed background - almost a shadow puppet.
The background is deeply shadowed, almost black, enhancing the sense of depth and isolation. A very soft, diffused key light gently illuminates just enough of the face to hint at features and reveal natural skin texture, but without brightening the subject significantly.
The eyes are sharply in focus, drawing the viewer in, and are often the brightest part of the subject, creating a compelling focal point. The background is softly blurred to create a sense of depth and separation. The overall mood is mysterious, evocative, and slightly melancholic, with a strong emphasis on form and silhouette. Think film noir.

>>>Unease Shadow Photo
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a photographer who deliberately captures a chaotic, disjointed visual language that feels raw, aggressive and unsettling.
The imagery is marked by extreme off-center compositions, tilted horizons, and fragmented framing that break conventional balance.
Lighting is harsh and directional, often from a single, low-angle source that creates deep, crushing shadows and stark, over-exposed highlights, giving every face a chiaroscuro, predatory look.
Colors are desaturated except for sudden spikes of saturated blood-red, electric-blue or neon-green, which appear as visual "flashes" that heighten tension.
A gritty, high-ISO grain texture covers the whole frame, while occasional motion blur and streaks suggest rapid, unpredictable movement.
Lens artifacts such as strong flare, double-exposure overlays and smudged spots are embraced, reinforcing the sense of visual distortion.
Each subject is lit and posed to appear as a potential threat: eyes catch the light in a glint, posture is angular, and the surrounding environment is cracked, fragmented or littered with debris.
Overall the photograph feels volatile, misaligned, and confrontational, like a frozen moment in a hostile, unpredictable world.

>>>80s Dark Fantasy Photo
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a still photographer on the set of a 1980s dark fantasy epic (think *Excalibur*, *Legend*, *Conan the Barbarian*, or *Hawk the Slayer*). The aesthetic is deliberately *not* pristine; it's a world built with practical effects, visible matte paintings, and a sense of tangible grit.
Your photograph showcases a heavily stylized composition, prioritizing atmosphere over hyper-realism. Lighting is dramatically theatrical, employing saturated colors: deep cobalt blues, fiery oranges and reds, sickly emerald greens, and bruised purples. Strong backlighting and rim lighting are key. Soft focus is used extensively to create a dreamlike quality, but with a slight edge to maintain a sense of danger. Emphasis is placed on creating a sense of scale and grandeur through forced perspective, miniature work, and atmospheric haze.  
Post-processing involves adding noticeable (but not overwhelming) film grain, bloom and glow effects around light sources (especially magical ones), a subtle color shift towards cooler tones, and a slight diffusion to soften details. There's a hint of optical distortion, reminiscent of early anamorphic lenses. The overall mood is one of brooding mystery and impending doom.

>>>Nostalgic Golden Hour
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a cinematographer and photographer who recreates the visual language of Steven Spielberg's dramatic adventure films from the 1980s.
The image has a cinematic feel. The lighting is natural sunset, creating a warm, honey-toned glow that gently envelops the subjects in a rim of light.
Lens flares are present: circular glows that follow the direction of the light source, adding a sense of wonder and depth.
The colors are rich but slightly muted; the primary tones (red, blue, green) retain their saturation, while the midtones have a warm, slightly desaturated hue reminiscent of films from that era. The contrast is high, preserving detail in the shadows and allowing the highlights to stand out with characteristic cinematic shading.
Finally, the organic grain adds texture, reinforcing the analog feel. The composition follows classic Spielberg motifs: the foreground interest (a character, an object, or a landscape element) draws the eye to a dynamic medium shot, with a deep, expansive background that hints at adventure or mystery.
The overall atmosphere is heroic, and slightly nostalgic, as if the viewer were watching a still from an iconic 80s adventure saga.

>>>Ultimate Anime
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a top-tier anime key visual artist specializing in high-fidelity CGI rendering. Your goal is to create promotional artwork that blends the expressive character designs of anime with the polished look of modern 3D animation.
The artwork is rendered at 8K (or higher) resolution with perfectly clean linework and seamless anti-aliasing. Color palettes are vibrant and harmonious, adhering to established character designs and world aesthetics.
Lighting is *critical*: a strong key light defines form, rim lighting separates the subject, and soft fill lights preserve detail. Highlights should have a pronounced bloom and subtle lens flares. Shadows are smoothly graded with a focus on realistic light diffusion.
Shading utilizes advanced rendering techniques like physically-based rendering (PBR) to create realistic material properties. Surfaces (skin, hair, fabric, metal) have a polished, three-dimensional feel with subtle subsurface scattering and detailed specular highlights. Avoid overly-stylized cell-shading; aim for a smooth gradient.
Backgrounds are richly composed, utilizing depth-of-field, atmospheric perspective, and subtle particle effects (digital glitches, energy particles, volumetric lighting) to enhance immersion. Backgrounds should *support* the characters, not distract from them.
Linework is clean and confident, with varying line weights to emphasize form. Consider a subtle digital "smoothing" effect to the lines.
Composition is dynamic and emotionally resonant: strong poses, expressive facial features like bright expressive anime eyes, and soft gradients and dynamic strands.  Think about the "rule of thirds" and leading lines.
The overall impression should be that of a high-budget anime promotional image rendered with cutting-edge CGI technology - visually striking, technically flawless, and deeply respectful of the source material. Consider elements like bloom, lens flares, and subtle chromatic aberration.

You are an American artist.
Your work has a Cubist style, with geometric and abstract forms.
You emphasize fragmented, multi-view facial geometry: you divide each face and body into angular fragments, and distorted shapes.
You avoid soft skin tones, photorealistic shading, or realistic contours; instead, you use flattened blocks of color, muted tonal contrast, and exaggerated angular distortion.
You eliminate any trace of photographic texture; you replace it with matte, painterly surfaces and bold contour strokes that separate each facet.
You ireassemble face features (eyes, nose, mouth) as disjointed, overlapping forms. You use a restricted, non-naturalistic palette (e.g., cadmium red, ultramarine, ochre, black) applied with flat, even washes.
In general, the composition should have an abstract, psychedelic and deformed appearance.
YOUR ABSTRACT ARTWORK:
{$@}


>>>Epic Greg
YOUR CONTEXT:
You are a master digital painter specializing in grand-scale heroic fantasy illustrations. Your work evokes the spirit of classic fantasy artists like Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo, and Brom.
Your illustration is a meticulously crafted digital oil painting, characterized by masterful, sweeping brushwork and thick impasto textures that give a sense of tangible depth.

The composition is classically inspired, often employing dynamic poses, heroic proportions, and a sense of epic scale.  Details are richly rendered, focusing on textures like weathered armor, flowing fabrics, and rugged landscapes. The palette is a moody blend of deep earth tones (ochres, umbers, siennas) accented by vibrant, glowing highlights (gold, crimson, azure) to create a legendary and immersive feel.

Characters sport elaborate cybernetic accessories, like holographic projections and light-emitting garments, rendered with stylized reflective materials and exaggerated glowing emissive effects. The lighting is multi-layered: radiant atmospheric glows, dynamic energy flares, and shifting chromatic beams that dissect the haze, interpreted with bold color and dramatic contrast. Compositionally, you combine tight, charismatic portrait shots with wider views, using *suggested* motion blur and particle effects to convey a pulsating, hyper-connected performance. The overall aesthetic leans towards a vibrant, energetic illustration reminiscent of contemporary anime keyframes.  The background is abstract and dynamic, focusing on light and color rather than a specific location.

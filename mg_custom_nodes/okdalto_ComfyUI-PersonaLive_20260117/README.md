# ComfyUI-PersonaLive

![PersonaLive](assets/main.jpg)

This is a ComfyUI custom node implementation of **PersonaLive: Expressive Portrait Image Animation for Live Streaming**.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this implementation only supports **Image Input** (driving the portrait with a single reference image). Video driving support is planned for future updates.

**Original Repository**: [GVCLab/PersonaLive](https://github.com/GVCLab/PersonaLive)  
**Paper**: [ArXiv 2512.11253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11253)

I deeply appreciate the authors **Zhiyuan Li, Chi-Man Pun, Chen Fang, Jue Wang,** and **Xiaodong Cun** for their amazing work and for sharing their code.

## 🛠 Installation

1.  **Clone this repository** into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    git clone https://github.com/okdalto/ComfyUI-PersonaLive
    cd ComfyUI-PersonaLive
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Model Setup**:
    
    **Option 1: Automatic Download (Recommended)**
    
    Models will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face when you first use the `PersonaLiveCheckpointLoader` node. The node will:
    - Detect missing models in your selected directory
    - Download required models (~15-20GB total):
      - `lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers` (Base Model)
      - `stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse` (VAE)
      - `huaichang/PersonaLive` (PersonaLive Weights)
    - Organize them into the correct structure automatically
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The first download will take some time depending on your internet speed. Models are cached locally, so subsequent loads will be instant.
    
    **Option 2: Manual Download**
    
    If you prefer to download models manually or have connectivity issues:
    
    Create a folder named `persona_live` inside your `ComfyUI/models/` directory with the following structure:
    ```
    ComfyUI/models/
    └── persona_live/
        ├── sd-image-variations-diffusers/  <-- Base Model
        ├── sd-vae-ft-mse/                  <-- VAE
        └── persona_live/                   <-- PersonaLive Repository
            └── pretrained_weights/         <-- .pth files location
                └── personalive/            <-- .pth files location    
                    ├── denoising_unet.pth
                    ├── motion_encoder.pth
                    ├── motion_extractor.pth
                    ├── pose_guider.pth
                    ├── reference_unet.pth
                    └── temporal_module.pth
    ```
    
    - **Download Base Models**:
        - [sd-image-variations-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers)
        - [sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse)
    - **Download PersonaLive Weights**:
        - Clone or download the entire repository from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/huaichang/PersonaLive)

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **PersonaLiveCheckpointLoader**: Select the `model_dir` (e.g., `persona_live`) that contains all your models.
2.  **PersonaLivePhotoSampler**:
    - Connect the pipeline from the loader.
    - Connect `ref_image` (source portrait) and `driving_image` (pose reference).
    - Set `width` and `height` (default 512). The node automatically resizes inputs to this resolution for processing and then restores the original resolution for the output.

### Usage Tips
- **Input Images**: It is highly recommended to use **square images (1:1 aspect ratio)** for both `ref_image` and `driving_image` to ensure the best face alignment and generation quality.
- **Inference Steps**: The model is optimized for **4 steps**. If you increase this value, ensure it is a **multiple of 4** (e.g., 8, 12, 16) to prevent errors.

## 🧪 Example Workflow

An example workflow is provided in the `example` folder. You can drag and drop the `.json` file from there into ComfyUI to get started quickly.

## 📝 To-Do
- [ ] Support Video Input (Driving Video)

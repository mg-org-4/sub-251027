"""Read generation settings out of the API prompt, for Civitai metadata.

Pure functions over the API-format prompt dict that ComfyUI hands a node as its
`prompt` hidden input. No ComfyUI / torch / PIL imports, so it unit-tests
standalone against real prompt JSON.

Harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_civitai_walk_test.py (runs against prompts pulled
from a live /api/history, with the fetched prompts cached as fixtures).

WHY WALK THE GRAPH AT ALL: the established packs make the user WIRE steps / cfg
/ seed into the saver node, with hardcoded defaults on every field, so an
unwired field silently ships a wrong value (alexopus defaults to Steps 20 and
CFG 7.0 whatever you actually rendered with). We already receive the whole
prompt, so reading it is both zero-config and honest. The rule throughout:
**when a value cannot be determined, return None and let the caller omit the
key.** Never substitute a plausible default - a wrong number in the metadata is
worse than a missing one, because the viewer cannot tell it is wrong.

API prompt shape, for reference:

        "LoRA trigger words, favourite sizes, step counts, or any value you retype often.\n\n"
        "Open the settings from the gear on the node, add your entries, and choose what the node "
        "sends out: text, a whole number, a decimal, or on/off. The output dot renames itself to "
        "match, so you can see at a glance what will come out.\n\n"
        "The small letter on the node decides which entry it sends each time you run, and you "
        "can click it to change: F keeps the entry you picked, I steps to the next one every "
        "run, and R picks any of them at random.\n\n"
        "It ignores whatever it is plugged into: the list and the type are yours, set on the "

        "of the input they are wired to.\n\n"
        "The list is saved inside the workflow, so sending someone the workflow sends your "
        "entries with it. Export and Import move a list between workflows.\n\n"

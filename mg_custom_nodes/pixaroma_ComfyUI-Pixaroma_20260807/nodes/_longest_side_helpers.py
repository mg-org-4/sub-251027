"""Longest Side Pixaroma - the pure maths.

No torch, no PIL, no ComfyUI: everything here is integers in, integers out, so
it can be unit-tested with the plain system Python and mirrored exactly in the
browser (js/longest_side/core.mjs). The browser copy paints the size preview on
the node face, and the face must never promise a size the run will not produce,
so the two have to agree on every value - which is why there is not a single
float division below.

The job, in order:
  1. crop_rect  - the largest rectangle of the wanted shape that fits the image
  2. target_size- scale that rectangle so its LONGER side hits the target
  3. snap       - round both sides to the step, if one is set

// Pixaroma Canvas Zoom - the user setting for the in-node mouse-wheel behaviour.
//
// Background: ComfyUI binds wheel-to-zoom on the <canvas>, and a node's DOM panel
// (addDOMWidget) is layered OVER it, so wheeling on a node body would never reach
// the canvas and zoom would silently stop there (issue #17). Every Pixaroma node
// with a DOM panel therefore calls installCanvasZoomPassthrough (the helper in
// js/shared/canvas_zoom.mjs), which forwards the wheel to the canvas.
//
// The helper's one judgement call is what to do over a SCROLLABLE field inside
// that panel (a long prompt textarea, a list): scroll the field, or zoom anyway.
// This extension registers the setting that decides. It adds no node and patches
// nothing - the actual behaviour lives in the helper.

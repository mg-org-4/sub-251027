    has NO jpeg workflow reader (verified in the bundle's
    getWorkflowDataFromFile), so drag-back restore works from PNG only - but
    other tools can read this, and a future frontend may add it.

    A big graph easily exceeds the ~65 KB JPEG EXIF segment limit and Pillow
    then raises AT SAVE TIME - so try workflow+prompt, fall back to workflow
    only, and skip embedding entirely when even that is too large (the JPG
    still saves; PNG is the reload format anyway).

    A1111-style `parameters` text goes in EXIF UserComment (0x9286, inside the
    Exif IFD 0x8769) with the standard 8-byte "UNICODE\\0" prefix + UTF-16-BE
    payload, which is what Civitai's reader expects and what piexif produces for
    encoding="unicode". It is preferred over the workflow, because it is normally
    small and it is the ONLY part Civitai can read - dropping it to make room for
    a giant workflow would defeat the point.

    But "normally small" is not always: UTF-16 costs 2 bytes per character, so a
    ~32000-character prompt alone busts the 64 KB limit. The ladder therefore ends
    with two attempts that DROP the user comment, so an enormous prompt costs only
    the Civitai part and still leaves the workflow EXIF that used to fit, rather
    than losing everything.

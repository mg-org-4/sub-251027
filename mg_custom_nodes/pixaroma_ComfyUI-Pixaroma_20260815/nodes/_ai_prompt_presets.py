"""AI Prompt Pixaroma - presets: a formula PLUS the settings that make it work.

A formula on its own is half a recipe. The Krea 2 formula was measured writing
gibberish at temperature 0.7 and doing the job cleanly at 0.3 on the same model
and the same words, so shipping the text without the number would have shipped
a formula that looks broken. A preset carries both.

WHERE THINGS LIVE, and why it is ONE file each rather than one file per preset:

    shipped   <plugin>/assets/ai_prompt_presets.json
    yours     <ComfyUI user dir>/pixaroma/ai_prompt_presets.json

A preset NAME is user text, and a name that becomes a FILENAME is the single
most common way a save feature turns into a path traversal (path-containment.md
#1: an absolute right-hand side silently discards the base). Keeping every user
preset inside one known JSON file means no path is ever built from user input at
all - there is nothing to contain, rather than something contained carefully.

Yours live outside the plugin folder for the same reason the Civitai key does:
the plugin folder is a git working tree, and a Manager reinstall would wipe it.

Nothing here is read at RUN time. Loading a preset copies its values onto the
node, so Python only ever sees the node's own state - which is why a preset can
never affect a render, only what the browser puts on the node.

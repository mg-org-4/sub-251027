"""Pure helpers for Save Text Pixaroma - no ComfyUI, no torch, no filesystem.

Save Text collects text across runs into ONE buffer that the node shows and a
.txt file mirrors. Almost all of that logic lives in the browser (js/save_text/),
because the browser is what owns the buffer; what lives here is the small set of
rules the WRITE ROUTE also needs, so the two sides cannot disagree about what an
entry is or what a .txt file is called.

Kept dependency-free so D:\\Claude Tests\\_save_text_test.py can import it with
any python.

        "A music model needs two different pieces of writing. The caption "

        + "words that actually get sung.\n\n"
        + "This node writes both from one idea. It runs a language model you "
        + "already have, on your own machine, twice on a single load: once for "

        + "Wire `caption` and `lyrics` straight into MiniMax Music 3 Text Encode, and "

      heading: "Length, and the duration wire",
      body:
        "The music model treats length as a CEILING. It can end a song early, "
        + "but anything past the limit is simply cut off part way through. So a "
        + "lyric written for three minutes against a thirty second setting gets "
        + "chopped.\n\n"
        + "Wire the `duration` output into the music node's `max_duration` and the two "
        + "can never disagree. The highest it accepts is 360 seconds.\n\n"
        + "A song can still come out shorter than you asked. That is the music model "
        + "stopping when the words run out, not a fault: it only sings what it was "
        + "given. Measured over ten songs, nine used the whole length and one stopped "
        + "at three quarters, because that seed happened to write half as many lines.\n\n"

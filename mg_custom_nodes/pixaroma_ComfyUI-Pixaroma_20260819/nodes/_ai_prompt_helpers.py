"""AI Prompt Pixaroma - the pure half.

No torch, no ComfyUI imports, so the whole of the text handling can be
exercised with a bare python and no model on disk
(harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_ai_prompt_test.py).

Two jobs live here:

1. Reading the state blob the browser injects. Every value in it is
   attacker-controlled in the same sense every widget value is - /prompt is
   unauthenticated - so nothing is trusted and everything is clamped.

2. Deciding what string the model is asked, and what comes out when there is
   no model to ask. That second case is the whole reason this node can be
   dropped into a live chain: a node with no model is a working pass-through,
   not an error.

THE FORMULA LIVES ON THE NODE, not in a file. That is the deliberate
difference from Video Prompt, whose formulas are shared files on disk. Three
nodes in a chain must be able to hold three different instructions, a
duplicate must get its own copy, and a shared workflow should carry its
instructions with it. It also removes a whole bug class Video Prompt had to
fix afterwards: a formula in a FILE is not part of the node's cache
signature, so editing one changed nothing until something else did
(video-prompt.md #8). A formula in the state blob re-runs by itself.

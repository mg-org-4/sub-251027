"""Music Prompt Pixaroma - named formula sets.

A SET is the pair of instructions plus the sampling that makes them work, under
a name that says what it is for: `MiniMax Music 3 (Qwen3.5 4B int8)`. That name
is the whole point - the node ships one measured set today, and a second model or
a second music model becomes another entry rather than a rewrite.

WHY A SET RATHER THAN A FORMULA. This node has TWO instructions and they are not
independent: the caption runs at temperature 0.3 to stay factual and the lyrics
at 0.8 or every song rhymes the same way. Shipping either without its numbers
ships something that looks broken (ai-prompt.md #14: a formula without its
settings is half a recipe).

THE SHIPPED SET IS GENERATED, NOT STORED. It is built at request time from
`_music_prompt_formulas.py`, which is itself generated from the probe files that
measured it. There is no `assets/music_prompt_presets.json`, so there is no
second copy to drift.

ALL user sets live in ONE json file. Never one file per set: a set name is user
text, and a name that becomes a filename is the standard route from a save
feature to a path traversal (path-containment.md #1). One known file means no
path is ever built from user input at all.

#
# ⚠️ It takes our `normalise` as an argument, and that is not optional. It was
# NOT generic when first reused: it called AI Prompt's own normalise, which wants
# a `formula` where a set has `caption` and `lyrics`, so every entry was dropped
# and the guard reported a file it had just written as unreadable. Verify the

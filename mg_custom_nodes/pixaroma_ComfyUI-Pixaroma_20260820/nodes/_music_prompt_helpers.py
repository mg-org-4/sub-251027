"""Music Prompt Pixaroma - the pure half.

No torch, no ComfyUI imports, so every decision this node makes can be
exercised with a bare python and no model on disk
(harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_music_prompt_test.py).

WHAT THIS NODE IS. `MiniMaxMusic3TextEncode` takes a `caption` and a `lyrics`
string, and they are different KINDS of writing: one describes the sound, the
other is sung out loud. AI Prompt emits one string, so today that is two nodes
and the idea has to be typed into both. This node takes the idea once and runs
the model twice on one load.

THE FORMULAS ARE BAKED IN, and that is the deliberate difference from AI
Prompt, whose whole design is that the formula lives on the node. Here the
wording is not the user's dial - it took three measured rounds to get the
lyrics one working and it is tuned to a TEMPERATURE as much as to a model
(ai-prompt.md #15.1: eight rewrites at 0.7 all failed and 0.3 fixed them with
no wording change). So the caption runs at 0.3 and the lyrics at 0.8, both
baked, and the CONTROLS on the face steer the song instead.

WHAT THE CONTROLS DO. They append the same natural-language clauses the
measurements used, because the shipped lyrics formula already reads length and
structure out of the idea. Measured inputs were literally
"a 30 second song about love" and "a song about love, 3 verses, 3 choruses and
a bridge", so `structure_clause` rebuilds exactly that shape rather than
inventing a directive block (ai-prompt.md #14b: prefer wording already measured
over new wording that reads better).

⚠️ VERSES ARE A REQUEST, NOT A GUARANTEE, and the face must not promise
otherwise. Measured: 1 and 2 come back exactly as asked on both seeds, 3
drifts, and asking for 6 returns 5. `MAX_VERSES` is 3 for that reason - do not
raise it without new measurements.

# The real ceiling, read from source rather than guessed:
# MAX_AUDIO_FRAMES 9000 / AUDIO_FRAMES_PER_SECOND 25 in

# the encode node itself defaults to 120.

VERSES_AUTO = 0

# ⚠️ AUTO NAMES THE SHAPE. It does not leave the model to infer it from prose.
#
# The formula ALREADY prescribes a shape per length in its own words. The model
# reads it unreliably, and both failures a user hit came from that:
#
#   - a 60 second song came back with one verse and one chorus - the UNDER-FORTY
#     shape - and ran 21 seconds;
#   - a 30 second song came back with an empty [Intro] on top of a full verse and
#     chorus, and the chorus was chopped off the end.
#
# Naming the shape outright fixes both, measured on one idea with four or five
# seeds an arm, nothing else moving:
#
#     60s  say nothing              3/5 filled the minute
#     60s  "2 verses and 2 choruses" 5/5 filled the minute
#
#     30s  say nothing              1/4 free of an empty section
#     30s  "1 verse and 1 chorus"   4/4 free of an empty section
#
# The thresholds ARE the formula's own table, so this states what it already
# says rather than inventing a policy. 90 seconds and up is deliberately absent:
# 120s and 180s both measured 1.00x on Auto, and an explicit 3 verses drifts back
# to 2 at 180s, so naming it there would make things worse. Do not fix what
# measures fine.
#
# This is not Auto quietly becoming something else. Auto means the length decides
# the shape; this is the length deciding it. The clause produced is BYTE-IDENTICAL
# to choosing that verse count by hand, which is why the measurements above
# transfer with no new run.
#
# ⚠️ TWO OTHER APPROACHES FAILED - see music-prompt.md #6, do not retry them:
# telling the writer a SHORTER target changed nothing (8 lines either way), and
# telling it not to leave a section empty produced 26 sung lines on one seed.
#
# ⚠️ THE THIRD FIELD IS LINES PER SECTION, and it exists because naming the
# SHAPE was not enough on its own at the short end.
#
# The user's 30 second song came back as a full verse and chorus and still got
# chopped mid-chorus - their audio had roughly five sung lines in 29 seconds, so
# the real pace is nearer SIX seconds a line than the three the formula states.
# Eight lines cannot fit thirty seconds at that pace, however tidy the shape is.
#
# Measured at 30s over three seeds, with the shape clause already in place:
#
#     nothing added                     8, 8, 8 sung lines
#     "about six lines in total"        8, 8, 8   <- a BUDGET is ignored
#     "with two lines in each section"  4, 4, 4   <- a COUNT is obeyed
#
# A per-section COUNT works where a total does not. Four lines is about 23
# seconds at that pace, which fits with room to spare - and a short lyric costs
# nothing, because MiniMax plays out the rest of the ceiling anyway.
#
# ⚠️ 40 TO 90 GOT ITS OWN LINE COUNT 2026-08-18, on the report the previous
# version of this note was explicitly waiting for. Two renders at 60 seconds,
# BY EAR, on the same 16 line lyric:
#
#     intro  9s -> 51s of singing -> cut inside line 10   (5.2s a line)
#     intro 18s -> 41s of singing -> stopped after line 9 (4.6s a line)
#
# So about NINE lines fit a sixty second song, and the band was asking for
# sixteen. Two verses and two choruses at two lines each is eight, which fits
# both cases and leaves the four section shape intact.
#
# The INTRO is the variable nobody can plan around: it DOUBLED between two runs
# of the same lyric, spending a third of the ceiling before a word is sung.
# That is why the budget aims short rather than at the measured maximum.
#
# ⚠️ The 5/5 "filled the minute" result that ADDED this band was read off the
# encode node's `seconds` output, which is only the CEILING the acoustic model
# produced. It never showed whether the singing fit, and it did not. The same
# output is why two earlier truncations got through. A rendered song is the
# acceptance test; `seconds` is a pre-filter and nothing more.
#
# A shorter lyric costs nothing here either: run two still came back 59 seconds
# with nine lines sung, so the music simply plays the rest.

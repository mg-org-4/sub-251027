"""AI Prompt Pixaroma - one local model, one saved instruction, text out.

The universal sibling of Video Prompt Pixaroma. That node knows about MiniMax
H3: modes derived from wires, duration tiers, a frame count. This one knows
about nothing - you give it a model and an instruction, wire in whatever you
have, and it hands back text. Which is what makes it chainable: the output is
a plain string and the input takes one, so a row of these is a row of steps.

The three calls that do the generating are exactly the ones core's own
TextGenerate node makes (comfy_extras/nodes_textgen.py): clip.tokenize, then
clip.generate, then clip.decode. Same parameters, same defaults, so a workflow
moved between the two behaves identically.

A NODE WITH NO MODEL IS A WORKING PASS-THROUGH, not an error. That is the
whole reason it can be dropped into a live chain and wired up afterwards, and
it is why there is no auto-picked substitute model here (Video Prompt has one
because it cannot function without a vision model; this one can).

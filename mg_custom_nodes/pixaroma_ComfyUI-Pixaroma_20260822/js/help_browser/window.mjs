// A draggable, resizable panel appended to document.body. It is NOT a node and
// NOT a DOM widget, so none of the Nodes 2.0 widget rules apply to it, and it
// renders identically in both renderers.
//
// Two deliberate behaviours, both different from js/shared/help.mjs's popup:
//
//   1. It STAYS OPEN across workflow switches. The small per-node popup closes
//      on loadGraphData because it belongs to one node; this window belongs to
//      the app. Anything it shows that depends on the open graph must therefore
//      be re-read on render, never cached across a switch.
//   2. It writes NOTHING that gets serialized into a workflow - no node.size,
//      no properties, no slots - so opening and closing it can never make a
//      clean workflow ask "Save Changes?" (Vue Compat #18).
//
// Position and size live in UNREGISTERED settings (Vue Compat #20: unregistered
// ids persist fine and add no rows to the Settings panel).

// Dropdown Pixaroma - the XY Plot sweep provider.
//
// This node keeps its list in node.properties.dropdownState and injects the
// chosen value into a hidden input at queue time (Vue Compat #9), so it has NO
// widget for XY Plot to enumerate and would never appear in the picker at all.
// Here we advertise one axis - which entry is picked - and patch the injected
// value per cell. Registered through js/shared/sweep_targets.mjs so neither side
// imports the other's internals.
//
// The axis VALUE is the entry's NAME, not its position. That is what makes the
// grid readable: the squares come out labelled "top left" and "full body", which
// is the whole reason for naming things in this node. The cost is that two
// entries sharing a name are ambiguous - see note().

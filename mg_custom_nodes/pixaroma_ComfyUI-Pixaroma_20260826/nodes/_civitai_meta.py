"""Build the Civitai-readable `parameters` metadata for a save node.

The ONE entry point a save node calls:

    from ._civitai_meta import build_metadata
    text = build_metadata(prompt, extra_pnginfo, unique_id, width, height)
    # -> a string to put in the PNG `parameters` chunk / EXIF UserComment,
    #    or None when there is nothing trustworthy to write.

This is the only module here that touches ComfyUI (`folder_paths`). The two it
builds on are pure and unit-tested standalone:
    _civitai_graph_walk.py   read the settings out of the API prompt
    _civitai_meta_helpers.py the A1111 string, hashing, the hash cache

DESIGN RULE, applied everywhere below: **omit rather than guess.** Every value is
value-or-None and a None key is simply left out, exactly as A1111 leaves out an
unset value. A wrong number in image metadata is worse than a missing one,
because whoever looks at the image cannot tell it is wrong. The same rule is why
`build_metadata` returns None instead of a half-string when it cannot find a
sampler: without `Steps: ` Civitai would not parse it anyway, so a partial string
is pure noise in the file.

WHY IT NEVER BLOCKS A SAVE: the whole body is wrapped by the caller in
try/except, and hashing is skipped (not waited for) when `allow_hash=False`.

# nodes/_video_prompt_helpers.py
"""Pure helpers for Video Prompt Pixaroma.

NO torch, NO ComfyUI imports at module scope, so the whole assembly can be
unit-tested with a bare python (harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_video_prompt_test.py).
Anything that needs a tensor lives in node_video_prompt.py instead.

WHAT THIS REPLACES
------------------
Three workflows, each about ten nodes, that differed only in which formula text
went into a Text Join Three. The formulas themselves were extracted verbatim
from those workflows on 2026-08-12, so a prompt built here is byte-identical to
one the tested workflows produced. The two things that make that true and are
easy to break:

  * the join is a SINGLE newline with empty parts skipped (the Text Join Three
    was configured `{"sep":"newline","skipEmpty":true}`), and
  * each formula already ENDS with "IDEA:\\n", so the join adds the blank line
    that the tested prompts had between that label and the idea.

Change either and every formula in the pack is being fed a shape it was never
measured against.

"""First Last Frame Pixaroma - the first and the last frame of a video, as two
images you can wire straight into Save Image.

The point of the node is continuation: render a clip, take its last frame, use
that as the start image of the next clip, and keep going.

TWO inputs because ComfyUI has two different things called "video" on the wire,
and they are not interchangeable:
  * video_frames (IMAGE) - a batch of frames, e.g. Load Video Pixaroma.
  * video (VIDEO)        - core's video object, e.g. ComfyUI's own Load Video.
Wire whichever you have. video_frames wins if both are connected.

The IMAGE path is pure tensor indexing. The VIDEO path prefers an ffmpeg
subprocess that lifts exactly two frames off the file (see
_first_last_helpers.py for why that is exact and why it is a subprocess), and
falls back to core's own get_components() whenever reading the file directly
would be wrong or impossible.

That fallback is a correctness floor, not a nice path. It decodes the WHOLE
clip into memory, which is what core's Get Video Components does too. MEASURED
on a 150-frame 1080x1920 clip (D:\\Claude Tests\\_first_last_memory.py): 7.16 GB
peak against 70 MB through ffmpeg, and 2.6x slower. The peak is double the
frame data because core builds a per-frame list and then stacks it, holding
both copies for a moment. Sample RSS from a background thread if you ever
re-measure it - reading before and after the call reports the residual, not the
peak, and made the fallback look like 61 MB.

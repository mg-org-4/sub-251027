// LoRA Loader Pixaroma - the XY Plot sweep provider.
//
// This node keeps its whole stack in node.properties.loraLoaderState and injects it
// into the hidden LoraLoaderState input at queue time (Vue Compat #9), so it has NO
// widget for XY Plot to enumerate - which is why the node never showed up in the XY
// picker at all. Here we advertise each row's file / strengths as pickable axes and
// patch the state blob per cell. Registered through js/shared/sweep_targets.mjs so
// neither side imports the other's internals.
//
// Axis identity is `pixlora:<row id>` + a subField ("name" | "sm" | "sc"). The row ID
// (not its position) is what gets SERIALIZED into the saved workflow, so reordering
// or deleting other rows never re-points a saved axis at the wrong LoRA.

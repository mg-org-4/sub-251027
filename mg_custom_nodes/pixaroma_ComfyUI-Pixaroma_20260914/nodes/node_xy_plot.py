"""XY Plot Pixaroma - run the workflow over every X x Y value combination and
assemble the results into a labeled comparison grid.

How it works (the heavy lifting is shared with Prompt Multi / Prompt Pack):
  - The frontend (js/xy_plot/) patches app.queuePrompt to loop ONE workflow run
    per (x, y) cell. Before each run it injects that cell's X and Y values into
    the TARGET nodes' widgets via app.graphToPrompt, and injects this node's
    per-cell cursor + the full label arrays into the hidden XYPlotState input
    (Vue Compat #9).
  - Each run, this node receives the cell image + the cursor. It accumulates the
    cell server-side keyed by a per-plot `sessionId`, (re)assembles the labeled
    grid PNG with PIL, hands the PNG filename to the frontend (custom ui key
    `pixaroma_xy_grid`) for the in-node <img> preview, and outputs the assembled
    grid tensor on the `grid` IMAGE slot. The grid is valid after every cell
    (missing/errored cells stay blank) and complete after the last one.
  - A normal Run (no plot cursor) just passes the image straight through.

The accumulator + cell PILs are also reachable by the save routes
(server_routes.py) so the Save buttons can write the grid (and optionally each
individual cell) to disk/output.

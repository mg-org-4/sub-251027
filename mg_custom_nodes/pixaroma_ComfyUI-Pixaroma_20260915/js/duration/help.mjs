        "Video models do not think in seconds, they think in frames. Worse, most of them will "

        + "and Hunyuan want every 4th frame plus 1.\n\n"
        + "That normally means wiring up two nodes: one holding the number of seconds, and one "
        + "doing maths on it. This node is both of them, and it shows you the answer before you "

        + "Buttons and type the lengths you want, such as 3, 5, 10, and the node gives you one "
        + "button each. Choose Slider instead and set a smallest and largest length, and you can "
        + "drag anywhere between them. Type it lets you enter any number inside the range.\n\n"
        + "Buttons suit a workflow where you always use the same two or three lengths. A slider "

"""LoRA Loader Pixaroma - stack many LoRAs in one node.

Front-end driven (Vue Compat #9): every LoRA row (file name, on/off, model and clip
strength, and the trigger words the user picked) lives on node.properties in the
browser and is injected into the hidden LoraLoaderState input by the graphToPrompt
hook in js/lora_loader/index.js. Because LoraLoaderState is part of the node's
inputs, editing a row changes the node's cache signature, so a run always picks up
the new value with no IS_CHANGED.

Python's job is small: for each switched-on row, apply its LoRA to the MODEL (and
CLIP) with its strengths, chaining them, and join the user's chosen trigger words
into the `triggers` STRING output. The metadata / trigger-word reading used by the
info panel lives in the pure, testable _lora_helpers module and in server_routes.

        "wire into your prompt. Trigger words are read straight from the file, so it "
        "works with no internet; an optional per-LoRA Civitai lookup can fetch the "
        "official words and a preview when you ask for it. Add LoRAs, all on/off, and "
        "the settings live in the middle of the node; right-click a row to move, "
        "duplicate, or remove it."

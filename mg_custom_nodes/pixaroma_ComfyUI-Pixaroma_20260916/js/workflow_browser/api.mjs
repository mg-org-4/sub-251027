// ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
//
// Deliberately the ONLY file in this feature that talks to the server or to
// ComfyUI's workflow store, so the calls that can cost somebody their work sit
// in one small file that can be read end to end.
//
// ── How a workflow is opened, and why it looks like this ────────────────────
//
// The obvious call is a trap. `app.extensionManager.workflow.openWorkflow(wf)`
// returns a Promise that resolves immediately and flips `activeWorkflow` to the
// target, but it NEVER LOADS THE GRAPH: measured against a real 14-node file,
// `isLoaded` stayed false and the canvas still showed the previous workflow
// after six seconds of polling, and the workflow was not even added to the open
// tabs. It is store bookkeeping, not an open.
//
// ComfyUI's own sidebar goes through a workflow SERVICE that lives in a
// hash-named chunk (dialogService-<hash>.js). That is not reachable from an
// extension - not on app.extensionManager, not in window.comfyAPI, and
// app.workflowManager does not exist - and importing the chunk by name would
// break on every frontend release.
//
// So we replay the app's own call, built only from stable public objects. This
// was verified against a live ComfyUI (2026-07-29):
//   - a 14-node file loads all 14 nodes into the correct tab, unmodified;
//   - switching AWAY from a workflow with unsaved edits does not lose them,
//     they stay in that workflow's tab exactly as with the native sidebar;
//   - switching BACK to an open, modified workflow restores the MODIFIED state,
//     not the version on disk.
//
// Two rules must never be relaxed:
//   1. NEVER pass { force: true } to load(). It refetches from disk and would
//      silently throw away unsaved edits.
//   2. NEVER call save()/saveAs() except from an explicit user action.

"""Load 3D Pixaroma - pick a 3D model, turn it to the view you want, and take the
model AND a picture of it out of one node.

The picture is drawn in the BROWSER. There is no 3D renderer in Python and the
pack adds no dependencies, so the node face renders the model with the vendored
three.js, and when Run is pressed the graphToPrompt hook in js/load_3d/index.js
draws it at the requested size, uploads it through ComfyUI's own /upload/image
into the temp folder, and injects the two names into the hidden Load3DState
input. ComfyUI's own Load 3D works the same way. A run started without a browser
therefore has no picture; the node says so rather than inventing one, unless
nothing downstream reads the picture at all.

The picture's width and height also come out as numbers, and can be wired IN.
The browser reads a wired size before Run when it can (Sizes Pixaroma, see
js/load_3d/size.mjs) and draws the picture at it. A wired size that still
disagrees with the picture stops the run, because the only way that happens is a
size the browser could not know in time, and a picture of the wrong size would
otherwise flow on silently.

The model itself comes straight from disk as a File3D, the type ComfyUI's 3D
nodes pass around (Save 3D, Preview 3D, Get 3D Components).

Pure helpers + harnesses: _load3d_helpers.py, D:\\Claude Tests\\_load3d_test.py,
_load3d_size_test.py, and _load3d_api_test.py (headless, run with the embedded python).

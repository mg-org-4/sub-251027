// =============================================================================
// Pixaroma toolbar visibility
//
// Pixaroma puts three buttons in ComfyUI's top action bar: Align, Workflows and
// Help. Not everyone wants all three, so each can be switched off in Settings.
// All three are ON by default, so nobody loses a button they already use.
//
// HIDING IS CSS, NOT UN-MOUNTING. Each button mounts on its own retry loop
// (app.menu.settingsGroup can be late on a cold start, so each one retries up
// to 20 times over 5s). Un-mounting would have to race three separate timers
// and re-run whenever one of them finally lands. A body class costs nothing,
// applies whether the button has appeared yet or not, and reverses instantly.
//
// HIDING THE BUTTON DOES NOT TURN THE FEATURE OFF:
//   - Workflows keeps Alt+W and its right-click-empty-canvas entry
//   - Help keeps Alt+H and its right-click-empty-canvas entry
//   - Align keeps snapping; its on/off lives in Settings under "Align"
// Those shortcuts are registered as ComfyUI COMMANDS, which have no connection
// to the DOM button, so they survive on their own. Nothing in this file has to
// keep them alive, and nothing here should ever try to.
// =============================================================================

import { app } from "/scripts/app.js";

// Each entry targets the button's GROUP wrapper, not the button itself: the
// group is the .comfyui-button-group that carries the toolbar's spacing, so
// hiding only the button would leave its gap behind.
//
// Each checkbox gets its OWN category leaf. Two settings under one shared leaf
// have been seen to render as a single row in this panel, which is why the repo
// already splits "Align" from "Align (advanced)". Three leaves beginning
// "Toolbar:" sort together, so they still read as one block.

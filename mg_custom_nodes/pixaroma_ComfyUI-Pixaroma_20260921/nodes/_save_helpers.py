    WHY (reported 2026-08-10 against Save Image): ComfyUI freezes the workflow
    into the file at QUEUE time, which is BEFORE that file exists. So the node's
    memory of its last result is still the PREVIOUS run's. Measured on a real
    pair: the workflow inside image_..._001.webp names image_..._001.png, the run
    before it. Drag that file into ComfyUI and the node confidently shows a
    different picture. It corrects itself on the next Run, which is exactly what
    made it look like a glitch rather than a bug.

    Core's own SaveImage shows NOTHING in that situation, so leaving ours to show
    the wrong thing is worse than core. Removing the key just means the node comes
    up empty until the first run.

    Only the EMBEDDED copy loses it. The browser keeps its own
    node.properties[prop_key], which is what a workflow-tab switch restores from,
    and the saved .json workflow is written from the browser too - so both of
    those are untouched and keep working exactly as before.

    ⚠️ MUST COPY, NEVER MUTATE. ComfyUI hands the SAME extra_pnginfo object to
    every node in a run (`extra_data.get('extra_pnginfo')` in execution.py), so
    stripping in place would silently edit what a SECOND save node embeds in its
    own file. That bug would look identical in review and only show up for
    someone with two save nodes.

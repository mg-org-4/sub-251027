// Number Pick Pixaroma - taking the type from whatever it is wired to.
//
// The user's question when this node was designed: "if we connect to one input
// that has float will work? like for example i have 24fps... or we need two
// output for int and float?". One output, and it fits the wire.
//
// THE SLOT TYPE IS ALWAYS "INT,FLOAT" AND IS NEVER NARROWED. LiteGraph reads a
// comma-joined type as a LIST of accepted names (Vue Compat #22, the same
// mechanism behind core's multi-type inputs and Dropdown's "STRING,COMBO"), and
// that one decision buys three things at once. MEASURED live, not assumed:
//   isValidConnection("INT,FLOAT", "INT")               -> true
//   isValidConnection("INT,FLOAT", "FLOAT")             -> true
//   isValidConnection("INT,FLOAT", "FLOAT,INT,BOOLEAN") -> true   (core's multi)
//   isValidConnection("INT,FLOAT", "MODEL" / "IMAGE" / "STRING") -> FALSE
// So: it reaches every numeric input, LiteGraph refuses a nonsensical wire for
// us with no disconnect logic and no toast, and one node can drive a whole
// number AND a decimal at the same time.
//
// ⚠ Do NOT "improve" this by narrowing the slot to the adopted type. MEASURED:
// isValidConnection("INT", "FLOAT") is FALSE, so a node that had adopted `int`
// could never be wired to a decimal input again without being unplugged first -
// which is exactly the "stuck as one type" bug sliders.md #13 was written about.
//
// What IS adopted is only `out`, the type Python emits the number as. Nothing
// about the canvas depends on it, so a wrong guess can never sever a wire.

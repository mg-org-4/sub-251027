"""Number Pick Pixaroma - the pure half.

No ComfyUI imports, so it can be tested on its own
(harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_number_pick_test.py).

The node holds one number, picked from buttons the user defines, and sends it
out with whatever type the input it is wired to expects. The browser decides
the TYPE by looking at that input (js/number_pick/adopt.mjs) and sends it here
as `out`; this file only has to honour it.

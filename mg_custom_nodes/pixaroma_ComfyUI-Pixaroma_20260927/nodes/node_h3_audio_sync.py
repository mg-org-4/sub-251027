"""H3 Audio Sync Pixaroma - make the picture sing YOUR track.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. MiniMax H3 generates video and sound together as one joined
latent, so left alone it invents its own audio and the mouth moves to a song
that does not exist. This node puts a real recording into the sound half and
pins it there, so the sampler can only change the picture - and the only picture
that fits a fixed soundtrack is one whose mouth matches it.

HOW IT HOLDS THE SOUND STILL. `noise_mask` is a NestedTensor of ones for the
video and zeros for the audio. That is ComfyUI's own feature, not a trick:
comfy/samplers.py unbinds a nested denoise_mask, pads it per stream and blends
every step, so a zero-masked stream is carried through untouched.

WHY THE FITTING HAPPENS IN THE WAVEFORM, NOT THE LATENT. Padding an audio latent
with zeros is NOT silence - zero is just another point in latent space and
decodes to a tone or hiss - and because the stream is then frozen, the model
paints video against that noise for the whole tail. Real samples padded with
real zeros are actual silence. See _h3_sync_helpers.target_samples.

ON THE MODEL PASSTHROUGH. `model` goes through completely untouched, and the
output exists so the node can sit inline in the chain rather than making you
route the wire around it. There IS a real thing that could be done here: the DiT
derives the audio stream's timestep from the video sigma
(comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py, `t_a = 1.0 - time_shift_sigma(...)`), so while we
hold the audio clean the model is still told it is noisy. Telling it otherwise
would need a core hook that does not exist in ComfyUI 0.30.1 - checked across
the whole tree and every installed package. Deliberately NOT faked with a model
patch: it would be an unverifiable guess about quality, and a wrong guess here
is invisible rather than loud.

Pure maths: _h3_sync_helpers.py + _audio_window_helpers.py.

        "H3 is unusual: it creates the picture and the sound at the same time, as one thing. That is "
        "why you cannot simply mute its audio and lay your own song on top afterwards, because the "
        "mouth was never moving to your song in the first place. This node drops your recording into "
        "the sound half and holds it still, so the only thing left for the model to decide is the "
        "picture that fits it.\n\n"
        "It works out how long the clip is by itself, so you never type a duration. If your track is "
        "shorter than the clip the node fills the rest with silence or loops it, whichever you chose, "
        "and says so on the node. If the clip is longer than about 15 seconds it warns you before the "
        "render rather than after, because H3 was only trained to about that length.\n\n"

"""Load Audio Pixaroma - pick a sound file, see it, take the part you want.

Deliberately model-agnostic. Everything about which frame counts a video model
accepts lives in Duration Pixaroma; this node only ever hears "take this many
seconds" and obeys, so it is just as useful for Wan, for Hunyuan, or for someone
who only wants to trim a voiceover.

Frontend-driven (Vue Compat #9): the file, the start point and the fallback
length live on node.properties in the browser and are injected into the hidden
LoadAudioState input by the graphToPrompt hook in js/load_audio/index.js. The
waveform is drawn in the browser from the real file, so nothing here has to
decode audio just to show a picture of it.

The window maths is pure and lives in _audio_window_helpers.py
(harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_audio_nodes_test.py).

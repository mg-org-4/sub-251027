"""Sketch Pixaroma - mark a picture for an edit model.

Draw boxes, circles, freehand loops, arrows or words on the picture right on the
node, write a short note beside each mark, and the node sends:
  - image  the picture with the marks drawn in, for the edit model to look at,
  - prompt the notes turned into an instruction ("Inside the red box: ..."),
  - mask   the marked areas, for an inpaint workflow instead.

Thin wrapper. Every decision lives in _sketch_helpers.py, which is pure and
tested (harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_sketch_test.py).

Frontend-driven (Vue Compat #9): the marks live on node.properties.sketchState
in the browser and reach this node through the hidden SketchState input, which
js/sketch/index.js fills from its graphToPrompt hook. No IS_CHANGED: the state
IS an input, so ComfyUI's own cache re-runs the node exactly when a mark or a
note changes.

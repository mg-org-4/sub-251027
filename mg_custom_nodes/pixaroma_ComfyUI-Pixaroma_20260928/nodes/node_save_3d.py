"""Save 3D Pixaroma - look at a 3D model, fix how it stands, then preview or save it.

The backend. The face (the square viewer, the views and looks, the Fix row and
the gear) lives in js/save_3d/. The settings live on node.properties in the
browser and arrive in the hidden Save3DState input (Vue Compat #9). The result
goes back in ui.pixaroma_save3d, stamped, because a cached node replays its
executed event (free-vram.md #5).

A run: read the input through _mesh3d_io (an OBJ keeps its quads, groups and
colours; a MESH, GLB or STL keeps its uvs, normals and textures), apply the Fix
(turns, center, on the ground), write OBJ, GLB or STL, into temp in Preview and
into the save folder in Save, and return that same file on model_3d, so the next
node gets exactly what was saved.

The report also carries what the face's LIVE Fix preview needs: `fix` (the turns
and the exact move that were applied, so the viewer can undo them) and `view`
(a file standing on Y, unscaled: the saved file itself when it is an OBJ or GLB
on Y that /view can serve, otherwise a separate temp file).

Save now (the button on the face) copies the last Preview file through the
/pixaroma/api/save3d/save_now route, which calls save_now() below. The save
folder follows Save Image's rules: empty is the output folder, anything else must
pass the shared guard (nodes/_path_guard.py).

Pure helpers + harness: _mesh3d.py, _save3d_helpers.py, D:\\Claude Tests\\_save3d_test.py.

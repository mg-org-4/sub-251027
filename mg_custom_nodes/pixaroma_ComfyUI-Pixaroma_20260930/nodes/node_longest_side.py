"""Longest Side Pixaroma - scale an image so its longer edge hits a chosen
size, optionally cropping it to a shape first.

The small sibling of Image Resize Pixaroma. It deliberately never asks for two
numbers: the size tab says how BIG, the shape chip says what SHAPE, and the step
button rounds both sides. Everything that needs an explicit width AND height
(fit inside, pad, match ratio) stays in Image Resize, which is what makes that
node eight rows tall and this one two.

All the arithmetic lives in _longest_side_helpers (pure, no torch), because the
browser mirrors it to paint the size preview on the node face and the two must
agree exactly. See .claude/patterns/ and the harness at
D:\\Claude Tests\\_longest_side_test.py.

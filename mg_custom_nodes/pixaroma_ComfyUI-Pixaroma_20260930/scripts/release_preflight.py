"""Release preflight: catches invisible junk and version drift before a release ships.

Run from the repo root:

    python scripts/release_preflight.py

Exits 0 when everything is clean, 1 with a report otherwise.

Why this exists: v1.4.72 shipped a pyproject.toml carrying a UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF).
The BOM is invisible in every editor, in grep and in a diff, but tomllib refuses the
file with "Invalid statement (at line 1, column 1)", so every tool that reads the pack
metadata (ComfyUI core, ComfyUI-Manager, the Comfy Registry, pip) sees a broken pack.
It came from a Windows shell redirect, which defaults to UTF-8-WITH-BOM here.
Same family as the literal-control-character trap recorded in CLAUDE.md convention #25.

    Only a module-level int LITERAL counts, in this file or in the one relative
    import that names it. Anything else returns None and the caller skips the
    value, so this can never invent a length and fail a clean release.

    KNOWN LIMIT: the FIRST module-level binding wins. A later rebind, an
    `x += 1`, or a class-body shadow of the same name would be read wrong and
    could fail a clean release. Left as is deliberately - every count constant
    in the pack (NUM, MAX_SLIDERS, MAX_ROWS, MAX_OUTS) is bound exactly once at
    module level, and a binding-counter to close it is easy to get subtly wrong
    in the direction that blocks a good release.

    ComfyUI sends the three lists to the browser separately and zips them BY

    tooltips. Dropdown Pixaroma builds RETURN_TYPES from a MAX_OUTS constant
    while the other two are literals, so raising the cap without editing them is
    an easy mistake to make and an invisible one to ship.

    This lives HERE rather than as an assert in the module, deliberately. The
    node is imported by __init__.py with no try/except, and ComfyUI's
    load_custom_node catches the failure with a logging.warning and moves on -
    so an assert would make every node in the pack disappear over a console line
    nobody reads. Failing the RELEASE instead costs nothing, covers every node
    rather than the one that carried the assert, and survives `python -O`.

    Parsed rather than imported: this script must not need torch or ComfyUI.

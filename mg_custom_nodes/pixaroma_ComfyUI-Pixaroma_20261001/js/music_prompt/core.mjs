// injected into the hidden MusicPromptState input at graphToPrompt time, so the
// node has no visible widgets and no stray input dots beyond the two real ones
// (clip, text).
//
// THE KEYS ARE snake_case ON PURPOSE, matching AI Prompt and Video Prompt:
// Python's parse_state reads them directly, so there is no camelCase mapping
// layer to get out of step.
//
// THERE IS NO FORMULA HERE, and that is the deliberate difference from AI
// Prompt, whose whole design is that the formula lives on the node. Both
// wordings here were measured, and the lyrics one took three rounds; they are
// tuned to a TEMPERATURE as much as to a model, so exposing them as an editable
// box would mostly offer people a way to break something that works. The
// CONTROLS are the dial instead.

// (+4 slack for font-metric differences between machines), and this node's
// title plus its three output slot rows cost a measured 86px on top - so
// anything under 440 pushes the readout's bottom and the button row below the
// node frame, which is exactly what the user reported ("if i make it smaller
// it doesnt look right"). The old 360 was a guess made before the face had
// settled.
//
// These live HERE, beside MIN_H, rather than in ui.mjs where the widget floor
// is used, because the two numbers are ONE fact and a comment cannot enforce
// an invariant. Split across two files, whoever adds a row to the face later
// bumps the widget floor, gets a correct Nodes 2.0 floor for free (the resize
// floor reads it directly) and a SILENTLY STALE Classic clamp - reproducing
// this very bug in one renderer only, which is the hardest shape to notice.
// ui.mjs imports core.mjs and core.mjs imports nothing, so the constant moves
// DOWN here cycle-free; the reverse would not be.

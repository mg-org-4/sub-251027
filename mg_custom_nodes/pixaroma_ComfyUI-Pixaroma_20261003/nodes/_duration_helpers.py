"""Duration Pixaroma - turning a length in seconds into a frame count.

Pure module: no torch, no ComfyUI, no I/O, so the maths can be tested on its own
and mirrored in the browser (js/duration/compute.mjs) with a parity check.

Every video model wants the same three things and disagrees only on the numbers:

    frames = round(seconds * fps)          how many frames that long is
    frames = max(frames, min_frames)       never below the model's floor
    frames = snap up to  step*n + plus     the shape the sampler demands

MiniMax H3 is step 17 plus 5 at 24 fps, which is where 5 s -> 124 frames comes
from. Wan is 4n+1 at 16 fps, LTX is 8n+1, Hunyuan is 4n+1. `step = 1` disables
snapping entirely, so "just frames = seconds x fps" needs no special mode.

A `custom` formula is the escape hatch for a model none of that fits. It is
evaluated with simpleeval - the SAME library and the same function allow-list
ComfyUI core uses for its own Math Expression node (comfy_extras/nodes_math.py).
Never use eval(): /prompt is unauthenticated, so this string is attacker-supplied
(see .claude/patterns/path-containment.md for the threat model).

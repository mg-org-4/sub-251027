"""Switch Source Pixaroma - flip a whole set of wires between two banks (A/B).

Each row has an A input and a B input and produces one output. A single A/B
toggle (in the JS frontend) selects which bank feeds every output at once.
Built for swapping a whole pipeline (e.g. local <-> api) in one click.

INPUT_TYPES pre-declares MAX_ROWS A inputs (a_1..a_16) followed by MAX_ROWS B
inputs (b_1..b_16) - the "two stacked banks" order - plus MAX_ROWS ANY outputs.
The JS frontend shows only the rows the user asked for (the Rows field). The
active bank, visible row count, missing-side mode, and per-side wiring are
carried via the hidden SwitchSourceState input (Pattern #9 - injected by the JS
app.graphToPrompt hook).

THE INACTIVE BANK IS SKIPPED SERVER-SIDE (lazy inputs). Every a_N/b_N is declared
"lazy": True and check_lazy_status() asks ComfyUI for ONLY the active bank, so the
other bank's upstream never executes. That is what makes an API-exported workflow
work: the JS cannot run for a headless /prompt submission, so a frontend-only
trick could never pick the bank there. The JS hook still prunes the inactive bank
at SUBMIT time (browser runs only) - now just a caching/validation optimisation,
not the mechanism. See "Switch Source" in CLAUDE.md.

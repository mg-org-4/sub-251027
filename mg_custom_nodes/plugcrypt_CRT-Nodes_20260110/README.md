# CRT-Nodes for ComfyUI

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of custom nodes for ComfyUI, designed to provide advanced capabilities in Image Post-Processing, Audio Processing, FLUX/WanVideo workflows, and general utility management.

**Note:** Some nodes can require specific external libraries including `pedalboard` (audio), `ultralytics` (face detection), `color-matcher`, and `sageattention`.

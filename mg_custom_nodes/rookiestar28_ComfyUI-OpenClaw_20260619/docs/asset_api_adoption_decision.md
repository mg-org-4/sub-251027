# ComfyUI Asset API Adoption Decision (2026-04-16)

## 2026-06-12 reconfirmation

- Current output parsing is media-aware for ComfyUI result groups `images`, `video`, `audio`, `3d`, and bounded `text`.
- File-like media refs still use `/view` when they provide `filename` or hash-backed preview metadata.
- Text output previews are bounded and rendered as text, not HTML.
- Asset-service-only identifiers remain explicit fallback states and still do not trigger automatic direct `/api/assets` fetches.

## 2026-05-31 reconfirmation

- Current host reference evidence shows upstream asset responses may expose `hash` alongside `asset_hash`.
- OpenClaw accepts `hash` as an alias for hash-backed previews, but still resolves those refs through `/view?filename=blake3:...`.
- This does not change the no-go decision for automatic direct `/api/assets` runtime fetches.

## Scope

- Goal: decide whether OpenClaw should adopt upstream `/api/assets` semantics as a normal runtime dependency beyond the bounded `/view` interoperability layer.

## Current baseline

- Current history/output-facing interop already accepts:
  - classic ComfyUI output refs (`filename`, `subfolder`, `type`)
  - asset-hash-backed refs that still resolve through `/view?filename=blake3:...`
  - media-aware output groups (`images`, `video`, `audio`, `3d`, and bounded `text`)
- Current ComfyUI `822aca19` / `v0.24.0-60-g822aca19` / pyproject `0.24.0` reference facts:
  - `/api/assets*` routes exist, but operational use is feature-gated behind `--enable-assets`
  - `/features` exposes the `assets` capability flag so hosts can report whether the asset system is enabled
  - frontend preview still resolves `blake3:...` asset hashes through `/view`, so hash-backed outputs do not require a direct `/api/assets` fetch
  - asset responses may expose `hash` alongside `asset_hash`; OpenClaw treats both as hash-backed preview aliases
- Current operator/runtime surfaces in scope:
  - sidebar `Jobs`
  - callback delivery payloads
  - history/result consumption paths derived from `services.comfyui_history`
- Current non-goal:
  - no gallery/explorer/runtime flow currently requires direct `/api/assets` fetches to stay functional.

## Decision

- **No-go for first-class `/api/assets` runtime adoption in phase 2.**
- OpenClaw keeps `/history` + `/view` as the supported runtime contract for normal output handling.
- Asset-api-only identifiers are treated as explicit unsupported contracts rather than implicit fetch targets.

## Rationale

1. Current OpenClaw output surfaces still succeed on the existing bounded `/view` contract, including asset-hash-backed refs.
2. Adding `/api/assets` as a normal dependency would widen runtime coupling to upstream host behavior without a demonstrated operator need in current features.
3. A silent fallback from `asset id only` to `/api/assets` would weaken boundary clarity and make host drift harder to reason about.

## Approved phase-2 seam

- Preserve current supported refs exactly:
  - classic refs -> `/view?filename=...&type=...`
  - asset-hash-backed refs -> `/view?filename=blake3:...`
  - file-like media refs -> `/view` fallback/link surfaces when preview metadata is present
  - bounded text refs -> escaped text surfaces, not HTML
- For refs that expose only asset-service identifiers and are not representable through `/view`:
  - keep them in normalized output payloads
  - mark them as `asset_api_required`
  - do not auto-fetch `/api/assets`
  - surface a bounded operator-facing message where relevant

## Re-open triggers

Revisit this decision only if one of the following becomes true:

1. A current operator-facing surface cannot complete its supported workflow without direct `/api/assets` semantics.
2. Upstream ComfyUI stops providing `/view`-compatible output metadata for supported runtime flows.
3. OpenClaw intentionally adds a new asset-management feature whose documented contract depends on asset-service metadata beyond hash-backed preview resolution.

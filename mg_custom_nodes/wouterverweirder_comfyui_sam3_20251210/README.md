# ComfyUI SAM3

ComfyUI custom node pack for **SAM3 (Segment Anything Model 3)** - Meta's state-of-the-art image segmentation model. This extension enables text-prompt-based object segmentation directly within your ComfyUI workflows.

## Overview

SAM3 is a powerful zero-shot segmentation model that can identify and segment objects in images using natural language prompts. This custom node pack brings SAM3's capabilities to ComfyUI, allowing you to:

- Segment objects using text descriptions (e.g., "person", "car", "dog")
- Filter results by confidence threshold
- Control minimum object dimensions
- Output individual masks for each detected object
- Generate a combined mask of all detections
- Visualize results with colored overlays, bounding boxes, and confidence scores

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Model Setup** - Choose one of the following options:
   
   **Option A: Auto-download from HuggingFace (recommended)**
   - Request model access at https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3
   - Login to huggingface using `hf auth login`
   - The model will automatically download on first use
   
   **Option B: Manual checkpoint placement**
   - Download `sam3.pt` manually from https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3/tree/main
   - Place the checkpoint file at: `ComfyUI/models/sam3/sam3.pt`
   - The node will automatically detect and use the local checkpoint
   
4. Restart ComfyUI.
5. Load example workflow from `workflow_example/Workflow_SAM3_image_text.json`

## Features

### SAM3 Segmentation Node

**Inputs:**

- **image** - Input image to segment (or batch of images for video model)
- **prompt** (STRING) - Text description of objects to segment (e.g., "person", "car", "building")
- **threshold** (FLOAT, 0.0-1.0) - Minimum confidence score threshold for detections (default: 0.5)
- **min_width_pixels** (INT) - Minimum bounding box width in pixels (default: 0)
- **min_height_pixels** (INT) - Minimum bounding box height in pixels (default: 0)
- **use_video_model** (BOOLEAN) - Enable video model for temporal tracking across frames (default: False)
- **object_ids** (STRING, optional) - Comma-separated list of object IDs to track (video model only, e.g., "0,1,2")

**Outputs:**

- **segmented_image** (IMAGE) - Visualization with colored mask overlays, bounding boxes, and confidence scores
- **masks** (MASK) - Batch of individual binary masks, one for each detected object `[B, H, W]`
- **mask_combined** (MASK) - Single merged mask containing all detected objects `[1, H, W]`

### Model Modes

#### Image Model (default)
- Processes each frame independently
- Faster inference
- No temporal consistency between frames
- Best for single images or when frame-to-frame tracking is not needed

#### Video Model
- Enables temporal tracking across multiple frames
- Assigns consistent object IDs across frames
- Tracks object movement and maintains identity
- Perfect for video sequences or animation frames
- Supports selective tracking via `object_ids` parameter
- Example: Set `object_ids="0,2"` to track only objects with IDs 0 and 2

**Video Model Features:**
- Object IDs are displayed on visualization with format "ID:X score"
- Objects maintain the same ID and color across frames
- Can filter specific objects by providing comma-separated IDs
- Leave `object_ids` empty to track all detected objects

**Example Use Cases:**

- Remove backgrounds by segmenting people or objects
- Isolate specific elements in a scene for further processing
- Create masks for inpainting workflows
- Generate batch masks for multiple objects of the same type
- Filter detections by size to focus on foreground/background objects
- Track objects across video frames with consistent IDs (video model)
- Follow specific objects through animation sequences (video model)
